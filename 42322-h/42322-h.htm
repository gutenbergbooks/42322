<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_VOLUMES_XXVI-XXVII" id="PREFACE_TO_VOLUMES_XXVI-XXVII"></a>PREFACE TO VOLUMES XXVI-XXVII</h2>


<p>These two volumes are devoted to reprints of Edmund
Flagg's <i>The Far West</i> (New York, 1838), and Father
Pierre Jean de Smet's <i>Letters and Sketches, with a Narrative
of a Year's Residence among the Indian Tribes of the
Rocky Mountains</i> (Philadelphia, 1843). Flagg's two-volume
work occupies all of our volume xxvi and the first part of
volume xxvii, the remaining portion of the latter being
given to De Smet's book.</p>

<p>Edmund Flagg was prominent among early American
prose writers, and also ranked high among our minor poets.
A descendant of the Thomas Flagg who came to Boston
from England, in 1637, Edmund was born November 24,
1815, at Wescasset, Maine. Being graduated with distinction
from Bowdoin College in 1835, in the same year he
went with his mother and sister Lucy to Louisville, Kentucky.
Here, in a private school, he taught the classics to
a group of boys, and contributed articles to the Louisville
<i>Journal</i>, a paper with which he was intermittently connected,
either as editorial writer or correspondent, until
1861.</p>

<p>The summer and autumn of 1836 found Flagg travelling
in Missouri and Illinois, and writing for the <i>Journal</i> the
letters which were later revised and enlarged to form <i>The
Far West</i>, herein reprinted. Tarrying at St. Louis in the
autumn of 1836, our author began the study of law, and
the following year was admitted to the bar; but in 1838
he returned to newspaper life, taking charge for a time of
the St. Louis <i>Commercial Bulletin</i>. During the winter of
1838-39 he assisted George D. Prentice, founder of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Louisville <i>Journal</i>, in the work of editing the Louisville
<i>Literary News Letter</i>. Finding, however, that newspaper
work overtaxed his health, Flagg next accepted an invitation
to enter the law office of Sergeant S. Prentiss at Vicksburg,
Mississippi, where in addition to his legal duties he
found time to edit the Vicksburg <i>Whig</i>. Having been
wounded in a duel with James Hagan of the <i>Sentinel</i> in
that city, Flagg returned to the less excitable North and
undertook editorial duties upon the <i>Gazette</i> at Marietta, Ohio
(1842-43), and later (1844-45) upon the St. Louis <i>Evening
Gazette</i>. He also served as official reporter of the Missouri
state constitutional convention the following year, and published
a volume of its debates; subsequently (until 1849)
acting as a court reporter in St. Louis.</p>

<p>The three succeeding years were spent abroad; first
as secretary to Edward A. Hannegan, United States minister
to Berlin, and later as consul at Venice. In February,
1852, he returned to America, and during the presidential
campaign of that year edited a Democratic journal at St.
Louis, known as the <i>Daily Times</i>. Later, as a reward for
political service, he was made superintendent of statistics
in the department of state, at Washington&mdash;a bureau
having special charge of commercial relations. Here he
was especially concerned with the compilation of reports on
immigration and the cotton and tobacco trade, and published
a <i>Report on Commercial Relations of the United States
with all Foreign Nations</i> (4 vols., Washington, 1858).
Through these reports, particularly the last named, Flagg's
name became familiar to merchants in both the United
States and Europe. From 1857 to 1860 he was Washington
correspondent for several Western newspapers, and from
1861 to 1870 served as librarian of copyrights in the department
of the interior. Having in 1862 married Kate Adeline,
daughter of Sidney S. Gallaher, of Virginia, he moved to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Highland View in that state (1870), and died there November
1, 1890.</p>

<p>In addition to his labors in the public service and as a
newspaper man, Flagg found time for higher literary work,
and won considerable distinction in that field. His first
book, <i>The Far West</i>, although somewhat stilted in style,
possesses considerable literary merit. Encouraged by the
success of his initial endeavor, he wrote the following year
(1839) the <i>Duchess of Ferrara</i> and <i>Beatrice of Padua</i>, two
novels, each of which passed through at least two editions.
The <i>Howard Queen</i> (1848) and <i>Blanche of Artois</i> (1850) were
prize productions. <i>De Molai</i> (1888), says the New York
<i>Sun</i> of the period, is "a powerful, dramatic tale which
seems to catch the very spirit of the age of Philip of France.
It is rare to find a story in which fact and invention are so
evenly and adroitly balanced." Our author also wrote several
dramas, which were staged in Louisville, Cincinnati,
St. Louis, and New York; he also composed numerous
poems for newspapers and magazines. His masterpiece,
however, was a history dedicated to his lifelong friend and
colleague, George D. Prentice, entitled <i>The City of the Sea</i>
(2 vols., New York, 1853). This work was declared by
the <i>Knickerbocker</i> to be "a carefully compiled, poetically-written
digest of the history of the glorious old Venice&mdash;a
passionate, thrilling, yet accurate and sympathetic account
of the last struggle for independence." At the time of his
death Flagg had in preparation a volume of reminiscences,
developed from a diary kept during forty years, but this has
never been published.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>"In hope of renovating the energies of a shattered constitution,"
we are told, Flagg started in the early part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
June, 1836, on a journey to what was then known as the
Far West. Taking a steamboat at Louisville, he went to
St. Louis by way of the Ohio and the Mississippi, and after
a brief delay ascended the latter to the mouth of the Illinois,
and thence on to Peoria. Prevented by low water
from proceeding farther, he returned by the same route to
St. Louis, whence after three weeks' stay, spent either in the
sick chamber or in making short trips about the city and its
environs, the traveller crossed the Mississippi and struck out
on horseback across the Illinois prairies, visiting Edwardsville,
Alton, Carlinsville, Hillsborough, Carlisle, Lebanon,
Belleville, and the American Bottoms. In July, after
recrossing the Mississippi, he visited in like manner St.
Charles, Missouri, by way of Bellefontaine and Florissant;
crossed the Mississippi near Portage des Sioux, and passed
through the Illinois towns of Grafton, Carrollton, Manchester,
Jacksonville, Springfield, across Grand Prairie to
Shelbyville, Mount Vernon, Pinkneyville, and Chester, and
returned to St. Louis by way of the old French settlements
of Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rocher, and Cahokia.</p>

<p>During this journey Flagg wrote for the Louisville <i>Journal</i>,
as already stated, a series of letters describing the country
through which he travelled. Hastily thrown together from
the pages of his note book, this correspondence appeared
anonymously under the title, "Sketches of a Traveller."
They were, however, soon attributed to Flagg, and two years
later were collected by the author and published in two
small volumes by Harper and Brothers (New York, 1838),
as <i>The Far West</i>. These volumes are in many respects
the best description of the Middle West that had appeared
up to the time they were written. Roughly following the
journals of Michaux, Harris, and Cuming by forty, thirty,
and twenty years respectively, Flagg skillfully shows the
remarkable growth and development of the Western coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>try.
His descriptions of the Ohio, Mississippi, and Illinois
rivers are still among the best in print, particularly from
the artistic standpoint. His account of the steamboat traffic
is valuable for the history of navigation on the Western
rivers, and shows vividly the obstacles which still confronted
merchants of that time. Chapters xi, xii, and xiii, dealing
with St. Louis and its immediate vicinity, are the most detailed
in our series, while the descriptions of St. Charles
and the Illinois towns through which Flagg passed, are excellent.</p>

<p>The modern reader cannot but wish that Flagg had
devoted less space to his youthful philosophizing, but the
atmosphere is at least wholesome. Unlike Harris, whose
criticism of Western society was keen and acrid, Flagg was
a man of broad sympathies, possessing an insight into human
nature remarkable for so youthful a writer&mdash;for he was
but twenty years of age at the time of his travels, and twenty-two
when the book was published. Although mildly reproving
the old French settlers for their lack of enterprise,
he fully appreciates their domestic virtues, and gives a faithful
picture of these pleasure-loving, contented, unprogressive
people. His description of the once thriving villages of
Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rocher, and Cahokia, are valuable
historically, as showing the decay settling upon the French
civilization after a few years of American occupation. Our
author's interview with the Mormon convert, his conversations
with early French and American settlers, his accounts
of political meetings, his anecdotes illustrating Western curiosity,
and particularly his carefully-recounted local traditions,
throw much light on the beliefs, manners, and customs of
the Western people of his time. <i>The Far West</i> is thus not
only a graphic and often forceful description of the interesting
region through which the author travelled, but a sympathetic
synopsis of its local annals, affording much varied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
information not otherwise obtainable. The present reprint,
with annotations that seek to correct its errors, will, we
think, prove welcome in our series.</p>

<p>In the <i>Letters and Sketches</i> of Father de Smet, we reprint
another Western classic, related to the volumes of Flagg
by their common terminus of travel at St. Louis.</p>

<p>No more interesting or picturesque episode has occurred
in the history of Christian missions in the New World, than
the famous visit made in the autumn of 1831 to General
William Clark at St. Louis by the Flathead chiefs seeking
religious instruction for their people. Vigorously exploited
in the denominational papers of the East, this delegation
aroused a sentiment that led to the founding of Protestant
missions in Oregon and western Idaho, and incidentally to
the solution of the Oregon question. But in point of fact,
the Flathead deputation was sent to secure a Catholic missionary;
and not merely one but four such embassies embarked
for St. Louis before the great desideratum, a "black
robe" priest, could be secured for ministration to this far-distant
tribe. Employed in the Columbian fur-trade were
a number of Christian Iroquois from Canada, who had been
carefully trained at St. Regis and Caughnawaga in all the
observances of the Roman Catholic church. Upon the
Pacific waterways and in the fastnesses of the Rockies, these
Iroquois taught their fellow Indians the ordinances of the
church and the commands of the white man's Great Spirit.
John Wyeth (see our volume xxi) testifies to the honesty
and humanity of the Flathead tribe: "they do not lie, steal,
nor rob any one, unless when driven too near to starvation."
He also testifies that they "appear to keep the Sabbath;"
and that their word is "as good as the Bible." These were
the neophytes who craved instruction, and to whom was
assigned that remarkable Jesuit missionary, Father Jean
Pierre de Smet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Born in Belgium in 1801, young De Smet was educated
in a religious school at Malines. When twenty years of
age he responded to an appeal to cross the Atlantic and
carry the gospel to the red men of the Western continent.
Arrived in Philadelphia (1821), the young Belgian was astonished
to see a well-built town, travelled roads, cultivated
farms, and other appurtenances of civilization; he had expected
only a wilderness and savages. Two years were
spent in the Jesuit novitiate in Maryland, before the zealous
youth saw any traces of frontier life. Then the youthful
novice was removed to Florissant, Missouri, not far from
St. Louis, where the making of a log-cabin and the breaking
of fresh soil furnished a mild foretaste of his future
career. Still more years elapsed before the cherished project
of missionary labor could be realized. In 1829 St. Louis
University was founded, and herein the young priest, who
had been ordained in 1827, was employed upon the instructional
force. Later years (1833-37) were spent in Europe,
while recruiting his health and securing supplies for
the infant university. It was not until 1838 that the first
missionary enterprise was undertaken by Father de Smet,
when a chapel for the Potawatomi was built on the site of
the modern Council Bluffs. There, in 1839, the fourth
Flathead deputation rested after the long journey from their
Rocky Mountain home; and at the earnest solicitation of the
young missioner, he was in the spring of 1840, detailed by
his superior to ascertain and report upon the prospects of a
mission to the mountain Indians.</p>

<p>Of the two tribesmen who had come down to St. Louis,
Pierre the Left-handed (Gaucher) was sent back to his
people with news of the success of the embassy, while his
colleague Ignace was detained to serve as guide to the
adventurous Jesuit who in April, 1840, set forth for the
Flathead country with the annual fur-trade caravan. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
route traversed was the well-known Oregon Trail as far as
the Green River rendezvous; there the father was rejoiced
to meet a deputation of ten Flatheads, sent to escort him to
their habitat, and at Prairie de la Messe was celebrated for
them the first mass in the Western mountains. The trail led
them on through Jackson's and Pierre's Holes; and in the
latter valley the waiting tribesmen to the number of sixteen
hundred had collected, and received the "black robe" as
a messenger from Heaven. Chants and prayers were heard
on every side; "in a fortnight," reports the delighted missionary,
"all knew their prayers." After two months spent
among his "dear Flatheads," wandering with them across
the divide, and encamping for some time at the Three Forks
of the Missouri&mdash;where nearly forty years before Lewis
and Clark first encountered the Western Indians&mdash;De Smet
took leave of his neophytes. Protected by a strong guard
through the hostile Blackfeet country, he arrived at last at
the fur-trade post of Fort Union at the junction of the
Missouri and the Yellowstone. Descending thence to St.
Louis he arrived there on the last day of December,
1840.</p>

<p>The remainder of the winter was occupied in preparations
for a new journey, and in securing men and supplies for
the equipment of the far-away mission begun under such
favorable auspices. Once more the father departed from
Westport&mdash;this time in May, 1841. The little company
consisted, besides himself, of two other priests and three lay
brothers, all of the latter being skilled mechanics. Among
the members of the caravan were a number of California
pioneers, one of whom has thus related his impressions of
the young missionary: "He was genial, of fine presence,
and one of the saintliest men I have ever known, and I cannot
wonder that the Indians were made to believe him
divinely protected. He was a man of great kindness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
great affability under all circumstances; nothing seemed to
disturb his temper."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Father de Smet's letters describe in detail the scenery and
incidents of the route from the eastern border of Kansas
to Fort Hall, in Idaho, where the British factor received the
travellers with abounding hospitality. Here some of the
Flatheads were in waiting to convey the missionaries to the
tribe, the chiefs of which met them in Beaver Head Valley,
Montana, and testified their welcome with dignified simplicity.
Passing over to the waters of the Columbia, they
founded the mission of St. Mary upon the first Sunday in
October, in the beautiful Bitter Root valley at the site of the
later Fort Owen. Thence Father de Smet made a rapid
journey in search of provisions to Fort Colville, on the upper
Columbia, but was again at his mission stockade before the
close of the year. In April a longer journey was projected,
as far as Fort Vancouver, on the lower Columbia, where Dr.
McLoughlin, the British factor, received the good priest with
that cordial greeting for which he was already famous.
During this journey the father narrowly escaped drowning in
the turbulent rapids of the Columbia, where five of his boatmen
perished. Returned to St. Mary's, the prospects for
a harvest of souls both among the Flatheads and the neighboring
tribes appeared so promising that the missionary
determined to seek re-enforcement and further aid in Europe.
Thereupon he left his companions in charge of the "new
Paraguay" of his hopes, and once more undertook the long
and adventurous journey to the settlements, this time by
way of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers, arriving at
St. Louis the last of October, 1842. At this point the journeys
detailed in the volume here reprinted come to an end.
The later career of Father de Smet and his subsequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
journeyings will be detailed in the preface to volumes xxviii
and xxix, in the latter of which will appear his <i>Oregon
Missions</i>.</p>

<p>Father de Smet's writings on missionary subjects ended
only with his death, and were increasingly voluminous and
detailed. The <i>Letters and Sketches</i> were his first published
work, with the exception of a portion of a compilation
that appeared in 1841, on the Jesuit missions of
Missouri. We find therefore, in the present reprint, the
vitality and enthusiasm of the young traveller relating new
scenes, and the abounding joy of the successful missionary
uplifting a barbaric race. The book was written with the
avowed purpose of creating interest in his newly-organized
work, and securing contributions therefor. The freshness
of description, the wholesome simplicity of the narrative,
the frank presentation of wilderness life, charm the reader,
and make this book a classic of early Western exploration.
Cast in the form of letters, wherein there is more or less
repetition of statement, it is nevertheless evident that these
have been subjected to a certain editorial revision, and that
literary quality has been considered. Aside from the interest
evoked by the personality of the writer, and the
events of his narrative, the work throws much light upon
wilderness travel, the topography and scenery of the Rocky
Mountain region, and above all upon the habits and
customs, modes of thought, social standards, and religious
conceptions of the important tribes of the interior.</p>

<p>After the present series of reprints had been planned for,
and announced in a detailed prospectus, there was issued
from the press of Francis P. Harper of New York the important
volumes edited by Major H. M. Chittenden and
Alfred Talbot Richardson, entitled <i>Life, Letters, and Travels
of Father Pierre Jean de Smet, S. J., 1801-73</i>. This publication
contains much new material, derived from manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>script
sources, which has been interwoven in chronological
order with the missionary's several books; and to it all have
been added an adequate biography and bibliography of
De Smet. This scholarly work has been of great service
to us in preparing for accurate reprint the original editions
of the only two of Father de Smet's publications that fall
within the chronological field of our series.</p>

<p>In the preparation for the press of Flagg's <i>The Far West</i>,
the Editor has had the assistance of Clarence Cory Crawford,
A. M.; in editing Father de Smet's <i>Letters and Sketches</i>,
his assistant has been Louise Phelps Kellogg, Ph.D.</p>

<p>In laying before the majesty of the public a couple of
volumes like the present, it has become customary for the
author to disclaim in his preface all original design of <i>perpetrating
a book</i>, as if there were even more than the admitted
<i>quantum</i> of sinfulness in the act. Whether or not such
disavowals now-a-day receive all the credence they merit,
is not for the writer to say; and whether, were the prefatory
asseveration, as in the present case, diametrically opposed
to what it often is, the reception would be different, is even
more difficult to predict. The articles imbodied in the following
volumes were, a portion of them, in their original,
hasty production, <i>designed</i> for the press; yet the author
unites in the disavowal of his predecessors of all intention
at that time of perpetrating <i>a book</i>.</p>

<p>In the early summer of '36, when about starting upon a
ramble over the prairies of the "Far West," in hope of renovating
the energies of a shattered constitution, a request was
made of the writer, by the distinguished editor of the Louisville
Journal, to contribute [vi] to the columns of that
periodical whatever, in the course of his pilgrimage, might be
deemed of sufficient interest.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">1</a> A series of articles soon after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
made their appearance in that paper under the title, "<i>Sketches
of a Traveller</i>." They were, as their name purports, mere
sketches from a traveller's <i>portfeuille</i>, hastily thrown upon
paper whenever time, place, or opportunity rendered convenient;
in the steamboat saloon, the inn bar-room, the log-cabin
of the wilderness, or upon the venerable mound of
the Western prairie. With such favour were these hasty
productions received, and so extensively were they circulated,
that the writer, on returning from his pilgrimage to
"the shrine of health," was induced, by the solicitations of
partial friends, to enter at his leisure upon the preparation
for the press of a mass of MSS. of a similar character, written
at the time, which had never been published; a thorough
revision and enlargement of that which had appeared, united
with <i>this</i>, it was thought, would furnish a passable volume
or two upon the "Far West." Two years of residence in
the West have since passed away; and the arrangement for
the press of the fugitive sheets of a wanderer's sketch-book
would not yet, perhaps, have been deemed of sufficient importance
to warrant the necessary labour, had he not been
daily reminded that his productions, whatever their merit,
were already public property so far as could be the case,
and at the mercy of every one who thought proper to assume
paternity. "Forbearance ceased to be longer a virtue," and
the result is now before the [vii] reader. But, while alluding
to that aid which his labours may have rendered to others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the author would not fail fully to acknowledge his own indebtedness
to those distinguished writers upon the West who
have preceded him. To Peck, Hall, Flint, Wetmore, and
to others, his acknowledgments are due and are respectfully
tendered.<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>In extenuation of the circumstance that some portions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of these volumes have already appeared, though in a crude
state, before the public, the author has but to suggest that
many works, with which the present will not presume to
compare, have made their debut on the unimposing pages of
a periodical. Not to dwell upon the writings of Addison
and Johnson, and other classics of British literature, several
of Bulwer's most polished productions, the elaborate Essays
of Elia, Wirt's British Spy, Hazlitt's Philosophical Reviews,
Coleridge's Friend, most of the novels of Captain Marryatt
and Theodore Hook, and many of the most elegant works
of the day, have been prepared for the pages of a magazine.</p>

<p>And now, with no slight misgiving, does the author commit
his firstborn bantling to the tender mercies of an impartial
public. Criticism he does not deprecate, still less
does he brave it; and farther than either is he from soliciting
undue favour. Yet to the <i>reader</i>, as he grasps him by the
hand in parting, would he commit his book, with the quaint
injunction of a distinguished but eccentric old English writer
upon an occasion somewhat similar:</p>

<p>"I exhort all people, gentle and simple, men, [viii] women,
and children, to buy, to read, to extol these labours of mine.
Let them not fear to defend every article; for I will bear
them harmless. I have arguments good store, and can easily
confute, either logically, theologically, or metaphysically, all
those who oppose me."</p>

<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Manfred.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>It was a bright morning in the early days of "leafy June."
Many a month had seen me a wanderer from distant New-England;
and now I found myself "once more upon the
waters," embarked for a pilgrimage over the broad prairie-plains
of the sunset West. A drizzly, miserable rain had
for some days been hovering, with proverbial pertinacity,
over the devoted "City of the Falls," and still, at intervals,
came lazily pattering down from the sunlighted clouds, reminding
one of a hoiden girl smiling through a shower of
April tear-drops, while the quay continued to exhibit all that
wild uproar and tumult, "confusion worse confounded,"
which characterizes the steamboat commerce of the Western
Valley. The landing at the time was thronged with steamers,
and yet the incessant "boom, boom, boom," of the high-pressure
engines, the shrill hiss of scalding steam, and the fitful
port-song of the negro firemen rising ever and anon upon the
breeze, gave notice of a constant [14] augmentation to the
number. Some, too, were getting under way, and their lower
<i>guards</i> were thronged by emigrants with their household
and agricultural utensils. Drays were rattling hither and
thither over the rough pavement; Irish porters were cracking
their whips and roaring forth alternate staves of blasphemy
and song; clerks hurrying to and fro, with fluttering
note-books, in all the fancied dignity of "brief authority;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
hackney-coaches dashing down to the water's edge, apparently
with no motive to the nervous man but noise; while
at intervals, as if to fill up the pauses of the Babel, some
incontinent steamer would hurl forth from the valves of her
overcharged boilers one of those deafening, terrible blasts,
echoing and re-echoing along the river-banks, and streets, and
among the lofty buildings, till the very welkin rang again.</p>

<p>To one who has never visited the public wharves of the
great cities of the West, it is no trivial task to convey an
adequate idea of the spectacle they present. The commerce
of the Eastern seaports and that of the Western Valley are
utterly dissimilar; not more in the staples of intercourse
than in the mode in which it is conducted; and, were one
desirous of exhibiting to a friend from the Atlantic shore a
picture of the prominent features which characterize commercial
proceedings upon the Western waters, or, indeed,
of Western character in its general outline, at a <i>coup d'&#339;il</i>,
he could do no better than to place him in the wild uproar
of the steamboat quay. Amid the "crowd, the hum, [15]
the shock" of such a scene stands out Western peculiarity
in all its stern proportion.</p>

<p>Steamers on the great waters of the West are well known
to indulge no violently conscientious scruples upon the subject
of punctuality, and a solitary exception at our behest,
or in our humble behalf, was, to be sure, not an event to be
counted on. "There's dignity in being waited for;" hour
after hour, therefore, still found us and left us amid the
untold scenes and sounds of the public landing. It is true,
and to the unending honour of all concerned be it recorded,
very true it is our doughty steamer ever and anon would
puff and blow like a porpoise or a narwhal; and then would
she swelter from every pore and quiver in every limb with
the ponderous labouring of her huge enginery, and the
steam would shrilly whistle and shriek like a spirit in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
confinement, till at length she united her whirlwind voice
to the general roar around; and all this indicated, indubitably,
an intention to be off and away; but a knowing
one was he who could determine the <i>when</i>.</p>

<p>Among the causes of our wearisome detention was one of
a nature too melancholy, too painfully interesting lightly to
be alluded to. Endeavouring to while away the tedium of
delay, I was pacing leisurely back and forth upon the <i>guard</i>,
surveying the lovely scenery of the opposite shore, and the
neat little houses of the village sprinkled upon the plain beyond,
when a wild, piercing shriek struck upon my ear. I
was hurrying immediately forward to the spot whence it
seemed to proceed, [16] when I was intercepted by some of
our boat's crew bearing a mangled body. It was that of
our second engineer, a fine, laughing young fellow, who had
been terribly injured by becoming entangled with the flywheel
of the machinery while in motion. He was laid upon
the passage floor. I stood at his head; and never, I think,
shall I forget those convulsed and agonized features. His
countenance was ghastly and livid; beaded globules of cold
sweat started out incessantly upon his pale brow; and, in
the paroxysms of pain, his dark eye would flash, his nostril
dilate, and his lips quiver so as to expose the teeth gnashing
in a fearful manner; while a muttered execration, dying
away from exhaustion, caused us all to shudder. And then
that wild despairing roll of the eyeball in its socket as the
miserable man would glance hurriedly around upon the
countenances of the bystanders, imploring them, in utter
helplessness, to lend him relief. Ah! it is a fearful thing to
look upon these strivings of humanity in the iron grasp of
a power it may in vain resist! From the quantity of blood
thrown off, the oppressive fulness of the chest, and the
difficult respiration, some serious pulmonary injury had
evidently been sustained; while a splintered clavicle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
limbs shockingly shattered racked the poor sufferer with
anguish inexpressible. It was evident he believed himself
seriously injured, for at times he would fling out his arms,
beseeching those around him to "hold him back," as if
even then he perceived the icy grasp of the death angel
creeping over his frame.</p>

<p>[17] Perhaps I have devoted more words to the detail of
this melancholy incident than would otherwise have been
the case, on account of the interest which some circumstances
in the sufferer's history, subsequently received from
the captain of our steamer, inspired.</p>

<p>"Frank, poor fellow," said the captain, "was a native
of Ohio, the son of a lone woman, a widow. He was all
her hope, and to his exertions she was indebted for a humble
support."</p>

<p>Here, then, were circumstances to touch the sympathies
of any heart possessed of but a tithe of the nobleness of our
nature; and I could not but reflect, as they were recounted,
how like the breath of desolation the first intelligence of
her son's fearful end must sweep over the spirit of this lonely
widow; for, like the wretched Constance, she can "never,
never behold him more."<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her life, her joy, her food, her all the world!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her widow-comfort, and her sorrow's cure!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While indulging in these sad reflections a gay burst of
music arrested my attention; and, looking up, I perceived
the packet-boat "Lady Marshall" dropping from her mooring
at the quay, her decks swarming with passengers, and
under high press of steam, holding her bold course against
the current, while the merry dashing of the wheels, mingling
with the wild clang of martial music, imparted an air
almost of romance to the scene. How strangely did this
contrast with that misery from which my eye had just turned!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>There are few objects more truly grand&mdash;I had [18]
almost said sublime&mdash;than a powerful steamer struggling
triumphantly with the rapids of the Western waters. The
scene has in it a something of that power which we feel upon
us in viewing a ship under full sail; and, in some respects,
there is more of the sublime in the humbler triumph of man
over the elements than in that more vast. Sublimity is a
result, not merely of massive, extended, unmeasured greatness,
but oftener, and far more impressively, does the sentiment
arise from a <i>combination</i> of vast and powerful objects.
The mighty stream rolling its volumed floods through half a
continent, and hurrying onward to mingle its full tide with
the "Father of Waters," is truly sublime; its resistless power
is sublime; the memory of its by-gone scenes, and the venerable
moss-grown forests on its banks, are sublime; and,
lastly, the noble fabric of man's workmanship struggling
and groaning in convulsed, triumphant effort to overcome
the resistance offered, completes a picture which demands
not the heaving ocean-waste and the "oak leviathan" to
embellish.</p>

<p>It was not until the afternoon was far advanced that we
found ourselves fairly embarked. A rapid freshet had
within a few hours swollen the tranquil Ohio far beyond its
ordinary volume and velocity, and its turbid waters were rolling
onward between the green banks, bearing on their bosom
all the varied spoils of their mountain-home, and of the rich
region through which they had been flowing. The finest
site from which to view the city we found to be the channel
of the Falls upon the Indiana side of the stream, called the
<i>Indian</i> [19] chute, to distinguish it from two others, called
the <i>Middle</i> chute and the <i>Kentucky</i> chute. The prospect
from this point is noble, though the uniformity of the structures,
the fewness of the spires, the unimposing character
of the public edifices, and the depression of the site upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
which the city stands, give to it a monotonous, perhaps a
lifeless aspect to the stranger.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1778 that a settlement was first commenced
upon the spot on which the fair city of Louisville
now stands.<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">4</a> In the early spring of that year, General George
Rodgers Clarke, under authority of the State of Virginia,
descended the Ohio with several hundred men, with the design
of reducing the military posts of Kaskaskia, Cahokia,
and Fort Vincent, then held by British troops. Disembarking
upon Corn Island at the Falls of the Ohio, opposite the
present city, land sufficient for the support of six families,
which were left, was cleared and planted with <i>corn</i>. From
this circumstance the island received a name which it yet
retains. General Clarke proceeded upon his expedition,
and, in the autumn returning successful, the emigrants were
removed to the main land, and a settlement was commenced
where Louisville now stands. During the few succeeding
years, other families from Virginia settled upon the spot, and
in the spring of 1780 seven stations were formed upon Beargrass
Creek,<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">5</a> which here empties into the Mississippi, and
Louisville commenced its march to its present importance.</p>

<p>The view of the city from the Falls, as I have remarked,
is not at all imposing; the view of the [20] Falls from the
city, on the contrary, is one of beauty and romance. They
are occasioned by a parapet of limestone extending quite
across the stream, which is here about one mile in width;
and when the water is low the whole chain sparkles with
bubbling foam-bells. When the stream is full the descent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
is hardly perceptible but for the increased rapidity of
the current, which varies from ten to fourteen miles an
hour.<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">6</a> Owing to the height of the freshet, this was the case
at the time when we descended them, and there was a wild
air of romance about the dark rushing waters: and the green
woodlands upon either shore, overshadowed as they were
by the shifting light and shade of the flitting clouds, cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
over the scene a bewitching fascination. "<i>Corn Island</i>,"
with its legendary associations, rearing its dense clump of
foliage as from the depths of the stream, was not the least
beautiful object of the panorama; while the receding city,
with its smoky roofs, its bustling quay, and the glitter and
animation of an extended line of steamers, was alone neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>sary
to fill up a scene for a limner.<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">7</a> And our steamer
swept onward [21] over the rapids, and threaded their maze
of beautiful islands, and passed along the little villages at
their foot and the splendid steamers along their shore, till
twilight had faded, and the dusky mantle of departed day
was flung over forest and stream.</p>

<p>Long before the dawn on the morning succeeding our
departure we were roused from our rest by the hissing of
steam and the rattling of machinery as our boat moved
slowly out from beneath the high banks and lofty sycamores
of the river-side, where she had in safety been
moored for the night, to resume her course. Withdrawing
the curtain from the little rectangular window of my stateroom,
the dark shadow of the forest was slumbering in
calm magnificence upon the waters; and glancing upward
my eye, the stars were beaming out in silvery brightness;
while all along the eastern horizon, where</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noidt">[22] rested a broad, low zone of clear heaven, proclaiming
the coming of a glorious dawn. The hated clang of the
bell-boy was soon after heard resounding far and wide in
querulous and deafening clamour throughout the cabins,
vexing the dull ear of every drowsy man in the terrible
language of Macbeth's evil conscience, "sleep no more!"
In a very desperation of self-defence I arose. The mists
of night had not yet wholly dispersed, and the rack and
fog floated quietly upon the placid bosom of the stream, or
ascended in ragged masses from the dense foliage upon
its banks. All this melted gently away like "the baseless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
fabric of a vision," and "the beauteous eye of day" burst
forth in splendour, lighting up a scene of unrivalled loveliness.</p>

<p>Much, very much has been written of "the beautiful
Ohio;" the pens of an hundred tourists have sketched its
quiet waters and its venerable groves; but there is in its
noble scenery an ever salient freshness, which no description,
however varied, can exhaust; new beauties leap forth
to the eye of the man of sensibility, and even an humble
pen may not fail to array them in the drapery of their own
loveliness. There are in this beautiful stream features
peculiar to itself, which distinguish it from every other that
we have seen or of which we have read; features which
render it truly and emphatically <i>sui generis</i>. It is not "the
blue-rushing of the arrowy Rhone," with castled crags and
frowning battlements; it is not the dark-rolling Danube,
shadowy with the legend of departed time, upon whose
banks armies have met and battled; it is not [23] the
lordly Hudson, roaming in beauty through the ever-varying
romance of the Catskill Highlands; nor is it the gentle
wave of the soft-flowing Connecticut, seeming almost to
sleep as it glides through the calm, "happy valley" of
New-England: but it is that noble stream, bounding forth,
like a young warrior of the wilderness, in all the joyance
of early vigour, from the wild twin-torrents of the hills; rolling
onward through a section of country the glory of a new
world, and over the wooded heights of whose banks has
rushed full many a crimson tide of Indian massacre. Ohio,<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">8</a>
"<i>The River of Blood</i>," was its fearfully significant name from
the aboriginal native; <i>La Belle Rivi&egrave;re</i> was its euphonious
distinction from the simple Canadian voyageur, whose light
pirogue first glided on its blue bosom. "The Beautiful
River!"&mdash;it is no misnomer&mdash;from its earliest commence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ment
to the broad <i>embouchure</i> into the turbid floods of the
Mississippi, it unites every combination of scenic loveliness
which even the poet's sublimated fancy could demand.<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">9</a> Now
it sweeps along beneath its lofty bluffs in the conscious
grandeur of resistless might; and then its clear, transparent
waters glide in undulating ripples over the shelly bottoms
and among the pebbly heaps of the white-drifted sand-bars,
or in the calm magnificence of their eternal wandering,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To the gentle woods all night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing they a sleepy tune."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From either shore streams of singular beauty and euphonious
names come pouring in their tribute [24] through the
deep foliage of the fertile bottoms; while the swelling, volumed
outlines of the banks, piled up with ponderous verdure
rolling and heaving in the river-breeze like life, recur
in such grandeur and softness, and such ever-varying combinations
of beauty, as to destroy every approach to monotonous
effect. From the source of the Ohio to its outlet its
waters imbosom more than an hundred islands, some of
such matchless loveliness that it is worthy of remark that
such slight allusion has been made to them in the numerous
pencillings of Ohio scenery. In the fresh, early summertime,
when the deep green of vegetation is in its luxuriance,
they surely constitute the most striking feature of the river.
Most of them are densely wooded to the water's edge; and
the wild vines and underbrush suspended lightly over the
waters are mirrored in their bosom or swept by the current
into attitudes most graceful and picturesque. In some of
those stretched-out, endless reaches which are constantly
recurring, they seem bursting up like beautiful <i>bouquets</i> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sprinkled evergreens from the placid stream; rounded and
swelling, as if by the teachings of art, on the blue bosom
of the waters. A cluster of these "isles of light" I well
remember, which opened upon us the eve of the second day
of our passage. Two of the group were exceedingly small,
mere points of a deeper shade in the reflecting azure; while
the third, lying between the former, stretched itself far away
in a narrow, well-defined strip of foliage, like a curving gash
in the surface, parallel to the [25] shore; and over the lengthened
vista of the waters gliding between, the giant branches
bowed themselves, and wove their mingled verdure into an
immense Gothic arch, seemingly of interminable extent, but
closed at last by a single speck of crimson skylight beyond.
Throughout its whole course the Ohio is fringed with wooded
bluffs; now towering in sublime majesty hundreds of feet
from the bed of the rolling stream, and anon sweeping inland
for miles, and rearing up those eminences so singularly
beautiful, appropriately termed "Ohio hills," while their
broad alluvial plains in the interval betray, by their enormous
vegetation, a fertility exhaustless and unrivalled. Here
and there along the green bluffs is caught a glimpse of the
emigrant's low log cabin peeping out to the eye from the
dark foliage, sometimes when miles in the distance; while
the rich maize-fields of the bottoms, the girdled forest-trees
and the lowing kine betray the advance of civilized existence.
But if the scenes of the Ohio are beautiful beneath the broad
glare of the morning sunlight, what shall sketch their lineaments
when the coarser etchings of the picture are mellowed
down by the balmy effulgence of the midnight moon of summer!
When her floods of light are streaming far and wide
along the magnificent forest-tops! When all is still&mdash;still!
and sky, and earth, and wood, and stream are hushed as a
spirit's breathing! When thought is almost audible, and
memory is busy with the past! When the distant bluffs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
bathed in molten silver, gleam like beacon-lights, and the
far-off vistas of the [26] meandering waters are flashing
with the sheen of their ripples! When you glide through
the endless maze, and the bright islets shift, and vary, and
pass away in succession like pictures of the kaleidoscope
before your eye! When imagination is awake and flinging
forth her airy fictions, bodies things unseen, and clothes
reality in loveliness not of earth! When a scene like this
is developed, what shall adequately depict it? Not the
pen.</p>

<p>Such, such is the beautiful Ohio in the soft days of early
summer; and though hackneyed may be the theme of its
loveliness, yet, as the dying glories of a Western sunset flung
over the landscape the mellow tenderness of its parting smile,
"fading, still fading, as the day was declining," till night's
dusky mantle had wrapped the "woods on shore" and the
quiet stream from the eye, I could not, even at the hazard
of triteness, resist an inclination to fling upon the sheet
a few hurried lineaments of Nature's beautiful creations.</p>

<p>There is not a stream upon the continent which, for the
same distance, rolls onward so calmly, and smoothly, and
peacefully as the Ohio. Danger rarely visits its tranquil
bosom, except from the storms of heaven or the reckless
folly of man, and hardly a river in the world can vie with it
in safety, utility, or beauty. Though subject to rapid and
great elevations and depressions, its current is generally uniform,
never furious. The forest-trees which skirt its banks
are the largest in North America, while the variety is endless;
several sycamores were pointed out to us upon the
shores from thirty to fifty feet in circumference. Its alluvial
[27] bottoms are broad, deep, and exhaustlessly fertile;
its bluffs are often from three to four hundred feet in height;
its breadth varies from one mile to three, and its navigation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
since the improvements commenced, under the authority of
Congress, by the enterprising Shreve, has become safe and
easy.<a name="FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_12" class="fnanchor">10</a> The classification of obstructions is the following:
<i>snags</i>, trees anchored by their roots; fragments of trees of
various forms and magnitude; <i>wreck-heaps</i>, consisting of several
of these stumps, and logs, and branches of trees lodged in
one place; <i>rocks</i>, which have rolled from the cliffs, and varying
from ten to one hundred cubic feet in size; and <i>sunken
boats</i>, principally flat-boats laden with coal. The last remains
one of the most serious obstacles to the navigation of
the Ohio. Many steamers have been damaged by striking
the wrecks of the <i>Baltimore</i>, the <i>Roanoke</i>, the <i>William Hulburt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">11</a>
and other craft, which were themselves snagged; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
keel and flat-boats without number have been lost from the
same cause.<a name="FNanchor_12_14" id="FNanchor_12_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_14" class="fnanchor">12</a> Several thousands of the obstacles mentioned
have been removed since improvements were commenced,
and accidents from this cause are now less frequent. Some
of the snags torn up from the bed of the stream, where they
have probably for ages been buried, are said to have exceeded
a diameter of six feet at the root, and were upward of an
hundred feet in length. The removal of these obstructions
on the Ohio presents a difficulty and expense not encountered
upon the Mississippi. In the latter stream, the root
of the snag, when eradicated, is deposited in some deep
[28] pool or bayou along the banks, and immediately imbeds
itself in alluvial deposite; but on the Ohio, owing to the
nature of its banks in most of its course, there is no opportunity
for such a disposal, and the boatmen are forced to
blast the logs with gunpowder to prevent them from again
forming obstructions. The cutting down and clearing away
of all leaning and falling trees from the banks constitutes an
essential feature in the scheme of improvement; since the
facts are well ascertained that trees seldom plant themselves
far from the spot where they fall; and that, when once under
the power of the current, they seldom anchor themselves
and form snags. The policy of removing the leaning and
fallen trees is, therefore, palpable, since, when this is once
thoroughly accomplished, no material for subsequent formation
can exist. The construction of stone dams, by which
to concentrate into a single channel all the waters of the
river, where they are divided by islands, or from other causes
are spread over a broad extent, is another operation now in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
execution. The dams at "Brown's Island,"<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">13</a> the shoalest
point on the Ohio, have been so eminently successful as fully
to establish the efficiency of the plan. Several other works
of a similar character are proposed; a full survey of the
stream, hydrographical and topographical, is recommended;
and, when all improvements are completed, it is believed
that the navigation of the "beautiful Ohio" will answer
every purpose of commerce and the traveller, from its source
to its mouth, at the lowest stages of the water.</p>

<p>Thump, thump, crash! One hour longer, and I was at
length completely roused from a troublous slumber by our
boat coming to a dead stop. Casting a glance from the
window, the bright flashing of moonlight showed the whole
surface of the stream covered with drift-wood, and, on
inquiry, I learned that the branches of an enormous oak,
some sixty feet in length, had become entangled with
one of the paddle-wheels of our steamer, and forbade all
advance.</p>

<p>We were soon once more in motion; the morning mists
were dispersing, the sun rose up behind the forests, and his
bright beams danced lightly over the gliding waters. We
passed many pleasant little villages along the banks, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
was delightful to remove from the noise, and heat, and confusion
below to the lofty <i>hurricane deck</i>, and lounge away
hour after hour in gazing upon the varied and beautiful
scenes which presented themselves in constant succession
to the eye. Now we were gliding quietly on through the
long island [30] chutes, where the daylight was dim, and
the enormous forest-trees bowed themselves over us, and
echoed from their still recesses the roar of our steam-pipe;
then we were sweeping rapidly over the broad reaches of
the stream, miles in extent; again we were winding through
the mazy labyrinth of islets which fleckered the placid surface
of the stream, and from time to time we passed the lonely
cabin of the emigrant beneath the venerable and aged sycamores.
Here and there, as we glided on, we met some relic
of those ancient and primitive species of river-craft which
once assumed ascendency over the waters of the West, but
which are now superseded by steam, and are of too infrequent
occurrence not to be objects of peculiar interest. In
the early era of the navigation of the Ohio, the species
of craft in use were numberless, and many of them of a
most whimsical and amusing description. The first was
the barge, sometimes of an hundred tons' burden, which
required twenty men to force it up against the current a
distance of six or seven miles a day; next the keel-boat,
of smaller size and lighter structure, yet in use for the
purposes of inland commerce; then the Kentucky flat,
or broad-horn of the emigrant; the enormous ark, in
magnitude and proportion approximating to that of the
patriarch; the fairy pirogue of the French voyageur; the
birch ca&iuml;que of the Indian, and log skiffs, gondolas, and
dug-outs of the pioneer without name or number.<a name="FNanchor_14_16" id="FNanchor_14_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_16" class="fnanchor">14</a> But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
since the introduction of steam upon the Western waters,
most of these unique and primitive contrivances [31] have
disappeared; and with them, too, has gone that singular
race of men who were their navigators. Most of the
younger of the settlers, at this early period of the country,
devoted themselves to this profession. Nor is there any
wonder that the mode of life pursued by these boatmen
should have presented irresistible seductions to the young
people along the banks. Fancy one of these huge boats
dropping lazily along with the current past their cabins
on a balmy morning in June. Picture to your imagination
the gorgeous foliage; the soft, delicious temperature of the
atmosphere; the deep azure of the sky; the fertile alluvion,
with its stupendous forests and rivers; the romantic bluffs
sleeping mistily in blue distance; the clear waters rolling
calmly adown, with the woodlands outlined in shadow on
the surface; the boat floating leisurely onward, its heterogeneous
crew of all ages dancing to the violin upon the
deck, flinging out their merry salutations among the settlers,
who come down to the water's edge to see the pageant pass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
until, at length, it disappears behind a point of wood, and
the boatman's bugle strikes up its note, dying in distance
over the waters; fancy a scene like this, and the wild bugle-notes
echoing and re-echoing along the bluffs and forest
shades of the beautiful Ohio, and decide whether it must
not have possessed a charm of fascination resistless to the
youthful mind in these lonely solitudes. No wonder that
the severe toils of agricultural life, in view of such scenes,
should have become tasteless and irksome.<a name="FNanchor_15_17" id="FNanchor_15_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_17" class="fnanchor">15</a> The lives of
these [32] boatmen were lawless and dissolute to a proverb.
They frequently stopped at the villages along their course,
and passed the night in scenes of wild revelry and merriment.
Their occupation, more than any other, subjected them to
toil, and exposure, and privation; and, more than any other,
it indulged them, for days in succession, with leisure, and
ease, and indolent gratification. Descending the stream,
they floated quietly along without an effort, but in ascending
against the powerful current their life was an uninterrupted
series of toil. The boat, we are told, was propelled by poles,
against which the shoulder was placed and the whole strength
applied; their bodies were naked to the waist, for enjoying
the river-breeze and for moving with facility; and, after
the labour of the day, they swallowed their whiskey and
supper, and throwing themselves upon the deck of the boat,
with no other canopy than the heavens, slumbered soundly
on till the morning. Their slang was peculiar to the race,
their humour and power of retort was remarkable, and in
their frequent battles with the squatters or with their fellows,
their nerve and courage were unflinching.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1811 that the steam-engine commenced
its giant labours in the Valley of the West, and the first
vessel propelled by its agency glided along the soft-flowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
wave of the beautiful river.<a name="FNanchor_16_18" id="FNanchor_16_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_18" class="fnanchor">16</a> Many events, we are told,
united to render this year a most remarkable era in the annals
of Western history.<a name="FNanchor_17_19" id="FNanchor_17_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_19" class="fnanchor">17</a> The spring-freshet of the rivers buried
the whole valley from Pittsburgh to New-Orleans [33] in a
flood; and when the waters subsided unparalleled sickness
and mortality ensued. A mysterious spirit of restlessness
possessed the denizens of the Northern forests, and in
myriads they migrated towards the South and West. The
magnificent comet of the year, seeming, indeed, to verify
the terrors of superstition, and to "shake from its horrid
hair pestilence and war," all that summer was beheld blazing
along the midnight sky, and shedding its lurid twilight over
forest and stream; and when the leaves of autumn began
to rustle to the ground, the whole vast Valley of the Mississippi
rocked and vibrated in earthquake-convulsion!
forests bowed their heads; islands disappeared from their
sites, and new one's rose; immense lakes and hills were
formed; the graveyard gave up its sheeted and ghastly tenants;
huge relics of the mastodon and megalonyx, which for
ages had slumbered in the bosom of earth, were heaved up
to the sunlight; the blue lightning streamed and the thunder
muttered along the leaden sky, and, amid all the elemental
war, the mighty current of the "Father of Waters" for hours
rolled back its heaped-up floods towards its source! All
this was the prologue to that mighty drama of <i>Change</i> which,
from that period to the present, has been sweeping over the
Western Valley; it was the fearful welcome-home to that
all-powerful agent which has revolutionized the character of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
half a continent; for at that epoch of wonders, and amid
them all, the first steamboat was seen descending the great
rivers, and the awe-struck Indian [34] on the banks beheld
the <i>Pinelore</i> flying through the troubled waters.<a name="FNanchor_18_20" id="FNanchor_18_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_20" class="fnanchor">18</a> The rise
and progress of the steam-engine is without a parallel in the
history of modern improvement. Fifty years ago, and the
prophetic declaration of Darwin was pardoned only as the
enthusiasm of poetry; it is now little more than the detail
of reality:</p>

<p class="noidt">The steam-engine, second only to the press in power, has

and admiration.</p>

<p>Return we to the incidents of our passage. During the
morning of our third day upon the Ohio we [35] passed,
among others, the villages of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Troy</i>, and Rockport.<a name="FNanchor_20_22" id="FNanchor_20_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_22" class="fnanchor">20</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
The latter is the most considerable place of the three, notwithstanding
<i>imposing</i> titles. It is situated upon a green
romantic spot, the summit of a precipitous pile of rocks some
hundred feet in height, from which sweeps off a level region
of country in the rear. Here terminates that series of beautiful
bluffs commencing at the confluence of the mountain-streams,
and of which so much has been said. A new
geological formation commences of a bolder character than
any before; and the face of the country gradually assumes
those features which are found near the mouth of the river.
Passing Green River with its emerald waters,<a name="FNanchor_21_23" id="FNanchor_21_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_23" class="fnanchor">21</a> its "Diamond
Island,"<a name="FNanchor_22_24" id="FNanchor_22_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_24" class="fnanchor">22</a> the largest in the Ohio, and said to be <i>haunted</i>,
and very many thriving villages, among which was Hendersonville,<a name="FNanchor_23_25" id="FNanchor_23_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_25" class="fnanchor">23</a>
for some time the residence of Audubon,<a name="FNanchor_24_26" id="FNanchor_24_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_26" class="fnanchor">24</a> the
ornithologist, we found ourselves near midday at the mouth
of the smiling Wabash, its high bluffs crowned with groves
of the walnut and pecan, the <i>carya oliv&#339;formis</i> of Nuttal,
and its deep-died surface reflecting the yet deeper tints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of its verdure-clad banks, as the far-winding stream gradually
opened upon the eye, and then retreated in the distance.
The confluence of the streams is at a beautiful angle; and,
on observing the scene, the traveller will remark that the
forests upon one bank are superior in magnitude to those
on the other, though of the same species. The appearance
is somewhat singular, and the fact is to be accounted
for only from the reason that the soil [36] differs in alluvial
character. It has been thought that no stream in the
world, for its length and magnitude, drains a more fertile
and beautiful country than the Wabash and its tributaries.<a name="FNanchor_25_27" id="FNanchor_25_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_27" class="fnanchor">25</a>
Emigrants are rapidly settling its banks, and a route has
been projected for uniting by canal its waters with those
of Lake Erie; surveys by authority of the State of Indiana
have been made, and incipient measures taken preparatory
to carrying the work into execution.<a name="FNanchor_26_28" id="FNanchor_26_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_28" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>About one hundred miles from the mouth of the Wabash
is situated the village of New-Harmony, far famed for the
singular events of which it has been the scene.<a name="FNanchor_27_29" id="FNanchor_27_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_29" class="fnanchor">27</a> It is said
to be situated on a broad and beautiful plateau overlooking
the stream, surrounded by a fertile and heavily-timbered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
country, and blessed with an atmosphere of health. It was
first settled in 1814 by a religious sect of Germans called
Harmonites, resembling the Moravians in their tenets, and
under the control of George Rapp, in whose name the land
was purchased and held. They were about eight hundred in
number, and soon erected a number of substantial edifices,
among which was a huge House of Assemblage an hundred
feet square. They laid out their grounds with beautiful regularity,
and established a botanic garden and an extensive
greenhouse. For ten years the Harmonites continued to
live and labour in love, in the land of their adoption,
when the celebrated Robert Dale Owen,<a name="FNanchor_28_30" id="FNanchor_28_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_30" class="fnanchor">28</a> of Scotland, came
among them, and, at the sum of one hundred and ninety
thousand dollars, purchased the establishment entire. His
design was of rearing up a community [37] upon a plan styled
by him the "Social System." The peculiar doctrines he
inculcated were a perfect equality, moral, social, political,
and religious. He held that the promise of never-ending
love upon marriage was an absurdity; that children should
become no impediment to separation, as they were to be
considered members of the community from their second
year; that the society should have no professed religion, each
individual being indulged in his own faith, and that all temporal
possessions should be held in common. On one night
of every week the whole community met and danced; and
on another they united in a concert of music, while the Sabbath
was devoted to philosophical lectures. Many distinguished
individuals are said to have written to the society
inquiring respecting its principles and prospects, and expressing
the wish at a future day to unite with it their desti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>nies.
Mr. Owen was sanguine of success. On the 4th of
July, 1826, he promulgated his celebrated declaration of
mental independence;<a name="FNanchor_29_31" id="FNanchor_29_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_31" class="fnanchor">29</a> a document which, for absurdity,
has never, perhaps, been paralleled. But all was in vain.
Dissension insinuated itself among the members; one after
another dropped off from the community, until at length
Mr. Owen retired in disgust, and, at a vast sacrifice, disposed
of the establishment to a wealthy Scotch gentleman
by the name of M'Clure, a former coadjutor.<a name="FNanchor_30_32" id="FNanchor_30_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_32" class="fnanchor">30</a> Thus was
abandoned the far-famed <i>social system</i>, which for a time
was an object of interest and topic of remark all over the
United States and even in Europe. The Duke of Saxe
Weimar passed here a [38] week in the spring of 1826, and
has given a detailed and amusing description of his visit.</p>

<p>About ten miles below the mouth of the Wabash is
situated the village of Shawneetown, once a favourite
dwelling-spot of the turbulent Shawnee Indian, the tribe of
Tecumseh.<a name="FNanchor_31_33" id="FNanchor_31_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_33" class="fnanchor">31</a> Quite a village once stood here; but, for
some cause unknown, it was forsaken previous to its settlement
by the French, and two small mounds are the only
vestige of its existence which are now to be seen. A
trading-post was established by the early Canadian
voyageurs; but, on account of the sickliness of the site,
was abandoned, and the spot was soon once more a
wilderness. In the early part of 1812 a land-office was
here located, and two years subsequent a town was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
laid off by authority of Congress, and the lots sold as
other public lands. Since then it has been gradually
becoming the commercial emporium of southern Illinois.</p>

<p>The buildings, among which are a very conspicuous bank,
courthouse, and a land-office for the southern district of
Illinois, are scattered along upon a gently elevated bottom,
swelling up from the river to the bluffs in the rear, but
sometimes submerged. From this latter cause it has formerly
been subject to disease; it is now considered healthy;
is the chief commercial port in this section of the state, and
is the principal point of debarkation for emigrants for the
distant West. Twelve miles in its rear are situated the Gallatin
Salines, from which the United States obtains some
hundred thousands of bushels of salt annually.<a name="FNanchor_32_34" id="FNanchor_32_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_34" class="fnanchor">32</a> It is manufactured
by [39] the evaporation of salt water. This is
said to abound over the whole extent of this region, yielding
from one eighth to one twelfth of its weight in pure muriate
of soda. In many places it bursts forth in perennial springs;
but most frequently is obtained by penetrating with the augur
a depth of from three to six hundred feet through the solid
limestone substratum, when a copper tube is introduced,
and the strongly-impregnated fluid gushes violently to the
surface. In the vicinity of these salines huge fragments
of earthenware, apparently of vessels used in obtaining
salt, and bearing the impress of wickerwork, have been
thrown up from a considerable depth below the surface.
Appearances of the same character exist near Portsmouth,
in the State of Ohio, and other places. Their origin is a
mystery! the race which formed them is departed!<a name="FNanchor_33_35" id="FNanchor_33_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_35" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

</div></div>


<p>It was near noon of the third day of our passage that we
found ourselves in the vicinity of that singular series of massive
rock formations, stretching along for miles upon the
eastern bank of the stream. The whole vast plain, extending
from the Northern Lakes to the mouth of the Ohio, and
from the Alleghany slope to the boundless prairies of the
far West, is said by geologists to be supported by a bed of
horizontal limestone rock, whose deep strata have never been
completely pierced, though penetrated many hundred feet
by the augur. This limestone is hard, stratified, imbedding
innumerable shells of the terebratul&aelig;, encrinites, orthocerites,
trilobites, productus, and other species. Throughout
most of its whole extent it supports a stratum of bituminous
coal, various metals, and saline impregnations: its constant
decomposition has fertilized the soil, and its absorbent and
cavernous nature has prevented swamps from accumulating
upon the surface. Such, in general outline, is this
vast limerock substratum [41] of the Western Valley. It
generally commences but a few feet below the vegetable
deposite; at other places its range is deeper, while at
intervals it rises from the surface, and frowns in castellated
grandeur over objects beneath. These huge masses of
limestone sometimes exhibit the most picturesque and
remarkable forms along the banks of the western rivers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and are penetrated in many places by vast caverns. The
region we were now approaching was a locality of these
singular formations, and for miles before reaching it, as
has been remarked, a change in scenery upon the eastern
bank is observed. Instead of the rounded wooded summits
of the "Ohio hills" sweeping beautifully away in the distance,
huge, ponderous rocks, heaped up in ragged masses,
"Pelion upon Ossa," are beheld rearing themselves
abruptly from the stream, and expanding their Briarean
arms in every direction. Some of these cliffs present a
uniform, jointed surface, as if of masonry, resembling
ancient edifices, and reminding the traveller of the giant
ruins of man's creations in another hemisphere, while
others appear just on the point of toppling into the river.
Among this range of crags is said to hang an <i>iron coffin</i>,
suspended, like Mohammed's, between heaven and earth.
It contains the remains of a man of singular eccentricity,
who, previous to his decease, gave orders that they should
be deposited thus; and the gloomy object at the close of
the year, when the trees are stripped of their foliage, may
be perceived, it is said, high up among the rocks from
the deck of the passing [42] steamer. This story probably
owes its origin to an event of actual occurrence somewhat
similar, at a cliff called by the river-pilots "Hanging
Rock."<a name="FNanchor_34_36" id="FNanchor_34_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_36" class="fnanchor">34</a> It is situated in the vicinity of "Blennerhasset's
Island."<a name="FNanchor_35_37" id="FNanchor_35_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_37" class="fnanchor">35</a> The first of these singular cliffs, called "Battery
Rock," stretches along the river-bank for half a mile, presenting
a uniform and perpendicular fa&ccedil;ade upward of eighty
feet in height. The appearance is striking, standing, as it
does, distinct from anything of a kindred character for miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
above and for some distance below. Passing several fine
farms, which sweep down to the water's edge, a second range
of cliffs are discovered, similar to those described in altitude
and aspect; but near the base, through the dark cypresses
skirting the water, is perceived the ragged entrance to a
large cavernous fissure, penetrating the bluff, and designated
by the name of "Rock-Inn-Cave."<a name="FNanchor_36_38" id="FNanchor_36_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_38" class="fnanchor">36</a> It is said to
have received this significant appellation from emigrants,
who were accustomed to tarry with their families for
weeks at the place when detained by stress of weather, stage
of the river, or any other circumstance unfavourable to
their progress.</p>

<p>It was near noon of a beautiful day when the necessary
orders for landing were issued to the pilot, and our boat
rounded up to the low sand-beach just below this celebrated
cavern. As we strolled along the shore beneath "the precipitous,
black, jagged rocks" overhanging the winding and
broken pathway towards the entrance, we could not but
consider its situation wild and rugged enough to please the
rifest fancy. The entrance, [43] at first view, is exceedingly
imposing; its broad massive forehead beetling over
the visiter for some yards before he finds himself within.
The mouth of the cavern looks out upon the stream
rushing along at the base of the cliff, and is delightfully
shaded by a cluster of cypresses, rearing aloft their huge
shafts, almost concealed in the luxuriant ivy-leaves
clinging to their bark. The entrance is formed into a
semi-elliptical arch, springing boldly to the height of forty
feet from a heavy bench of rock on either side, and eighty
feet in width at the base, throwing over the whole a
massive roof of uniform concavity, verging to a point near
the centre of the cave. Here may be seen another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
opening of some size, through which trickles a limpid
stream, and forming an entrance to a second chamber, said
to be more extensive than that below. The extreme length
of this cavern is given by Schoolcraft<a name="FNanchor_37_39" id="FNanchor_37_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_39" class="fnanchor">37</a> as one hundred
and sixty feet, the floor, the roof, and the walls gradually
tapering to a point. The rock is a secondary limestone,
abounding with testacea and petrifactions, a fine specimen
of which I struck from the ledge while the rest of our
party were recording their names among the thousand
dates and inscriptions with which the walls are defaced.</p>

<p>Like all other curiosities of Nature, this cavern was, by
the Indian tribes, deemed the residence of a <i>Manito</i><a name="FNanchor_38_40" id="FNanchor_38_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_40" class="fnanchor">38</a> or
spirit, evil or propitious, concerning [44] whom many a
wild legend yet lives among their simple-hearted posterity.
They never pass this dwelling-place of the divinity without
discharging their guns (an ordinary mark of respect),
or making some other offering propitiatory of his favour.
These tributary acknowledgments, however, are never of
much value. The view of the stream from the left bench
at the cave's mouth is most beautiful. Immediately in
front extends a large and densely-wooded island, known by
the name of the Cave, while the soft-gliding waters flow
between, furnishing a scene of natural beauty worthy an
Inman's pencil; and, if I mistake not, an engraving of
the spot has been published, a ferocious-looking personage,
pistol in hand, crouched at the entrance, eagerly watching
an ascending boat. This design originated, doubtless, in
the tradition yet extant, that in the latter part of the last
century this cavern was the rendezvous of a notorious band<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of freebooters which then infested the region, headed by
the celebrated Mason,<a name="FNanchor_39_41" id="FNanchor_39_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_41" class="fnanchor">39</a> plundering the boats ascending
from New-Orleans and murdering their crews. From these
circumstances this cave has become the scene of a poem
of much merit, called the "Outlaw," and has suggested a
spirited tale from a popular writer. Many other spots in
the vicinity were notorious, in the early part of the present
century, for the murder and robbery of travellers, whose
fate long remained enveloped in mystery. On the summit of a
lofty bluff, not far from the "Battery Rock," was pointed
out to us a solitary house, with a single chimney rising from
its roof. Its [45] white walls may be viewed for miles before
reaching the place on descending the river. It was here
that the family of Sturdevant carried on their extensive
operations as counterfeiters for many years unsuspected;
and on this spot, in 1821, they expiated their crimes with
their lives. A few miles below is a place called "Ford's
Ferry,"<a name="FNanchor_40_42" id="FNanchor_40_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_42" class="fnanchor">40</a> where murder, robbery, forgery, and almost every
crime in the calendar were for years committed, while not
a suspicion of the truth was awakened. Ford not only
escaped unsuspected, but was esteemed a most exemplary
man. Associated with him were his son and two other individuals,
named Simpson and Shouse. They are all now
gone to their account. The old man was mysteriously shot
by some person who was never discovered, but was supposed
to have been Simpson, between whom and himself a
misunderstanding had arisen. If it were so, the murderer
was met by fitting retribution, for <i>he</i> fell in a similar manner.
Shouse and the son of Ford atoned upon the gallows their
crimes in 1833. Before reaching this spot the traveller passes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
a remarkable mass of limestone called "Tower Rock." It
is perpendicular, isolated, and somewhat cylindrical in
outline. It is many feet in altitude, and upon its summit
tradition avers to exist the ruins of an antique tumulus;
an altar, mayhap, of the ancient forest-sons, where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Garlands, ears of maize, and skins of wolf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shaggy bear, the offerings of the tribe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were made to the Great Spirit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the vicinity of the cliff called "Tower Rock," and not
far from Hurricane Island, is said to exist a [46] remarkable
cavern of considerable extent. The cave is entered by an
orifice nine feet in width and twelve feet high; a bench of
rock is then ascended a few feet, and an aperture of the
size of an ordinary door admits the visiter into a spacious
hall. In the mouth of the cavern, on the fa&ccedil;ade of the cliff,
at the altitude of twenty-five feet, are engraved figures resembling
a variety of animals, as the bear, the buffalo, and
even the lion and lioness. All this I saw nothing of, and
am, of course, no voucher for its existence; but a writer in
the Port Folio, so long since as 1816, states the fact, and,
moreover, adds that the engraving upon the rock was executed
in "a masterly style."<a name="FNanchor_41_43" id="FNanchor_41_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_43" class="fnanchor">41</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>From this spot the river stretches away in a long delightful
reach, studded with beautiful islands, among which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"Hurricane Island," a very large one, is chief.<a name="FNanchor_42_44" id="FNanchor_42_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_44" class="fnanchor">42</a> Passing
the compact little village of Golconda with its neat courthouse,
and the mouth of the Cumberland River with its
green island, once the rendezvous of Aaron Burr and his
chivalrous band, we next reached the town of Paducah, at
the outlet of the Tennessee.<a name="FNanchor_43_45" id="FNanchor_43_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_45" class="fnanchor">43</a> This is a place of importance,<a name="FNanchor_44_46" id="FNanchor_44_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_46" class="fnanchor">44</a>
though deemed unhealthy: it is said to have derived its name
from a captive Indian woman, who was here sacrificed by
a band of the Pawnees after having been assured of safety.
About eight miles below Paducah are situated the ruins of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Fort Massac, once a French military post of importance.<a name="FNanchor_45_47" id="FNanchor_45_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_47" class="fnanchor">45</a>
There is a singular legend respecting this fort still popular
among the inhabitants of the neighbouring region, the outlines
of which [47] are the following: The fortress was
erected by the French while securing possession of the Western
Valley, and, soon after, hostilities arising between them
and the natives, the latter contrived a stratagem, in every
respect worthy the craft and subtlety of the race, to obtain
command of this stronghold. Early one morning a body
of Indians, enveloped each in a bearskin, appeared upon
the opposite bank of the Ohio. Supposing them the animal
so faithfully represented, the whole French garrison in
a mass sallied incontinently forth, anticipating rare sport,
while the remnant left behind as a guard gathered themselves
upon the glacis as spectators of the scene. Meanwhile, a
large body of Indians, concealed in rear of the fort, slipped
silently from their ambush, and few were there of the French
who escaped to tell the tale of the scene that ensued. They
were <i>massacred</i> almost to a man, and hence the name of
<i>Massac</i> to the post. During the war of the revolution a
garrison was stationed upon the spot for some years, but
the structures are now in ruins. A few miles below is a
small place consisting of a few farmhouses, called Wilkinsonville,<a name="FNanchor_46_48" id="FNanchor_46_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_48" class="fnanchor">46</a>
on the site where Fort Wilkinson once stood; just
opposite, along the shore, commences the "Grand Chain"
of rocks so famous to the Ohio pilot, extending four miles.
The little village of Caledonia is here laid off among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
bluffs. It has a good landing, and is the proposed site of a
marine hospital.</p>

<p>It was sunset when we arrived at the confluence of the rivers.
In course of the afternoon we had been visited by a violent
thunder-gust, accompanied [48] by hail. But sunset came,
and the glorious "bow of the covenant" was hung out
upon the dark bosom of the clouds, spanning woodland and
waters with its beautiful hues. And yet, though the hour
was a delightful one, the scene did not present that aspect
of vastness and sublimity which was anticipated from the
celebrity of the streams. For some miles before uniting
its waters with the Mississippi, the Ohio presents a dull
and uninteresting appearance. It is no longer the clear,
sparkling stream, with bluffs and woodland painted on its
surface; the volume of its channel is greatly increased by its
union with two of its principal tributaries, and its waters
are turbid; its banks are low, inundated, and clothed with
dark groves of deciduous forest-trees, and the only sounds
which issue from their depths to greet the traveller's ear
are the hoarse croakings of frogs, or the dull monotony of
countless choirs of moschetoes. Thus rolls on the river
through the dullest, dreariest, most uninviting region
imaginable, until it sweeps away in a direction nearly
southeast, and meets the venerable Father of the West advancing
to its embrace. The volume of water in each seems
nearly the same; the Ohio exceeds a little in breadth, their
currents oppose to each other an equal resistance, and the
resultant of the forces is a vast lake more than two miles
in breadth, where the united waters slumber quietly and
magnificently onward for leagues in a common bed. On
the right come rolling in the turbid floods of the Mississippi;
and on looking upon it for the first time with preconceived
ideas of the magnitude of the mightiest [49] river on the
globe, the spectator is always disappointed. He considers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
only its breadth when compared with the Ohio, without
adverting to its vast depth. The Ohio sweeps in majestically
from the north, and its clear waters flow on for miles
without an intimate union with its turbid conqueror. The
characteristics of the two streams are distinctly marked
at their junction and long after. The banks of both are
low and swampy, totally unfit for culture or habitation.
"Willow Point," which projects itself into the confluence,
presents an elevation of twenty feet; yet, in unusual inundations,
it is completely buried six feet below the surface,
and the agitated waters, rolling together their masses, form
an enormous lake. How strange it seemed, while gazing
upon the view I have attempted to delineate, now fading
away beneath the summer twilight&mdash;how very strange was
the reflection that these two noble streams, deriving their
sources in the pellucid lakes and the clear icy fountains of
their highland-homes, meandering majestically through scenes
of nature and of art unsurpassed in beauty, and draining,
and irrigating, and fertilizing the loveliest valley on the globe&mdash;how
strange, that the confluence of the waters of such
streams, in their onward rolling to the deep, should take
place at almost the only stage in their course devoid entirely
of interest to the eye or the fancy; in the heart of a dreary
and extended swamp, waving with the gloomy boughs of
the cypress, and enlivened by not a sound but the croaking
of bullfrogs, and the deep, surly misery note of [50]
moschetoes! Willow Point is the property of a company
of individuals, who announce it their intention to elevate
the delta above the power of inundations, and here to
locate a city.<a name="FNanchor_47_49" id="FNanchor_47_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_49" class="fnanchor">47</a> There are as yet, however, but a few
storehouses on the spot; and when we consider the incalculable
expense the only plan for rendering it habitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
involves, we can only deem the idea of a city here as the
chimera of a Utopian fancy. For more than twelve
miles above the confluence, the whole alluvion is annually
inundated, and forbids all improvement; but were this site
an elevated one, a city might here be founded which
should command the immense commerce of these great
rivers, and become the grand central emporium of the
Western Valley.</p>

<p>Upon the first elevated land above the confluence stands
the little town called America. This is the proposed <i>terminus</i>
to the grand central railroad of the Internal Improvement
scheme of Illinois, projected to pass directly through
the state,<a name="FNanchor_48_50" id="FNanchor_48_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_50" class="fnanchor">48</a> uniting its northern extremity with the southern.
The town is said to have been much retarded in its
advancement by the circumstance of a sand-bar obstructing
the landing. It has been contemplated to cut a basin,
extending from the Ohio to a stream called "Humphrey's
Creek," which passes through the place, and thus secure
a harbour. Could this plan be carried into execution,
America would soon become a town of importance.</p>

<p>It was late before we had passed the confluence of the
Ohio with the dark-rolling tide of the "endless river," and
the mellow gorgeousness of summer sunset had gently
yielded to the duskiness of twilight, and that to the inky
pall of night. The moon had not risen, and the darkness
became gradually so dense that doubts were entertained
as to the prudence of attempting to stem the mighty
current of the Mississippi on such a night. These, however,
were overruled; and, sweeping around the low peninsula
of Cairo, our steamer met the torrent and quivered in
every limb. A convulsed, motionless struggle ensued, in
which the heavy labouring of the engine, the shrill
whistle of the safety-valve, the quick, querulous crackling
of the furnaces, the tumultuous rushing of the wheels, and
the stern roar of the scape-pipe, gave evidence of the fearful
power summoned up to overcome the flood. At length
we began very slowly to ascend the stream. [52] Our
speed was about five miles an hour, and the force of the
current nearly the same, which so impedes advancement
that it requires as long to ascend from the confluence to
St. Louis as to descend to the same point from the Falls,
though the distance is less than half. All night our steamer
urged herself slowly onward against the current, and the
morning found us threading a narrow channel amid a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
cluster of islands, from whose dense foliage the night-mists
were rising and settling in dim confusion. Near the
middle of the stream, above this collection, lays a very
large island, comprising eight or ten thousand acres. It is
called English Island;<a name="FNanchor_49_51" id="FNanchor_49_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_51" class="fnanchor">49</a> is heavily timbered; huge vines
of the wild grape are leaping like living things from branch
to branch, and the wild pea flourishes all over the surface
of the soil in most luxuriant profusion. The stream here
expands itself to the breadth of four miles, and abounds
with islands.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced the sun burst gloriously forth
from the mists; and as I gazed with tranquillized delight
upon the beautiful scenery it unrolled, I remembered that
it was the morning of the Sabbath&mdash;the peaceful Sabbath.
It is a sweet thing to pass the hours of holy time amid the
eloquent teachings of inanimate nature. It is pleasant to
yield up for a season the sober workings of reason to the
warm gushings of the heart, and to suffer the homage of
the soul to go up before the Author of its being unfettered
by the chill formalities, the bustling parade, the soulless
dissembling of the unbending courtesies of ordinary life.
Amid the [53] crowded assemblage, there is but little of that
humbleness of spirit and that simple-hearted fervour of
worship which it is in man to feel when communing within
the shadowy solitudes of Nature with his God. There are
moments, too, when the soul of man is called back from
the heartlessness of life, and pours forth its emotions, gush
upon gush, in all the hallowed luxuriance of its nature;
when, from the fevered turmoil of daily existence, it retires
to well up its sympathies alone beneath the covert of a lulled
and peaceful bosom; and surely such a season is the calm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
waveless hour of Sabbath sacredness. And it is a blessed
appointment that, in a world whose quietude too often is
disturbed by the untamed heavings of unholy feeling, there
should yet be moments when the agitated events of the past
are forgotten, when the apprehensions of the future are unthought
of, and the generous emotions of the heart are no more
repressed. Such moments are the crystal fount of the <i>oasis</i>,
girt, indeed, by the sands and barrenness of the desert; yet
laughing forth in tinkling melody amid its sprinkled evergreens,
in all the sparkling freshness of mimic life, to bathe
the languid lip of the weary one. Such moments are the
mellow radiance of the departing sun when the trials of the
day are over; and tenderly and softly do their influences
descend upon the heart. Like the pure splendour of the
star of even, how calmly does the sacred Sabbath-time beam
out from the dark, unquiet firmament of life! 'Tis the
blessed rainbow of promise and of consolation amid the
rough storms of our pilgrimage, [54] and its holy influences
elicit all the untold richness of the heart. It is a season
soft as the memorial of buried affection, mild as the melody
of departed years, pure as the prayer of feebleness from the
lip of childhood, beautiful as yon floating islet sleeping in
sunset radiance on the blue evening wave. "Gone, gone
for ever!" Another Sabbath is over, and from its gathering
shades it is good to cast back a glance of reflection.</p>

<p>A company of emigrants, in course of the morning, were
landed from our boat at a desolate-looking spot upon the
Missouri shore; men, women, and little ones, with slaves,
household stuff, pots, kettles, dogs, implements of husbandry,
and all the paraphernalia of the backwood's farm heaped
up promiscuously in a heterogeneous mass among the undergrowth
beneath the lofty trees. A similar party from the
State of Vermont were, during our passage, landed near
the mouth of the Wabash, one of whom was a pretty, delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
female, with an infant boy in her arms. They had been
<i>deck-passengers</i>, and we had seen none of them before; yet
their situation could not but excite interest in their welfare.
Poor woman! thought I, as our boat left them gazing anxiously
after us from the inhospitable bank, little do you
dream of the trials and the privations to which your destiny
conducts, and the hours of bitter retrospection which are to
come over your spirit like a blight, as, from these cheerless
solitudes, you cast back many a lingering thought to your
dear, distant home in New-England; whose very mountain-crags
and fierce storms [55] of winter, harsh and unwelcome
though they might seem to the stranger, were yet pleasant
to you:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My native land! my native land!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though bare and bleak thou be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scant and cold thy summer smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou'rt all the world to me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A few years, and all this will have passed away. A new
home and new ties will have sprung up in the wilderness
to soothe the remembrance of the old. This broad valley
will swarm with population; the warm breath of man will
be felt upon the cheek, and his tread will be heard at the
side; the glare of civilization and the confused hum of business
will have violated these solitudes and broken in upon
their gloom, and here empire shall have planted her throne;
and then, perchance, that playful boy upon the bosom may
rise to wield the destinies of his fellows. But many a year
of toil and privation must first have passed away; and who
shall record their annals? A thousand circumstances, all
unlooked for, will seize upon the feelings of the emigrant;
the harshness of strangers, the cold regard of recent acquaintance,
the absence of relatives and of friends long cherished,
the distance which separates him from his native home, and
the dreary time which must elapse between all communications
of the pen. And then the sweet chime of the Sab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>bath-bell
of New-England, pealing out in "angels' music"<a name="FNanchor_50_52" id="FNanchor_50_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_52" class="fnanchor">50</a>
on the clear mountain-air, to usher in the hours of holy
time, and to summon the soul of man to communion with
its Maker; will this be heard amid the forest solitude? and
all that quiet [56] intermingling of heart with heart which
divests grief of half its bitterness by taking from it all its
loneliness? And the hour of sickness, and of death, and
of gushing tears, as they come to all, may not be absent
here; and where are the soothing consolations of religious
solemnity, and the sympathies of kindred souls, and the
unobtrusive condolence of those who alone may enter the
inner temple of the breast, where the stranger intermeddleth
not? Yes, it must be&mdash;notwithstanding the golden
anticipations indulged by every humble emigrant to this El
Dorado of promise&mdash;it must be that there will arise in his
bosom, when he finds himself for the first time amid these
vast forest solitudes, attended only by his wife and children,
a feeling of unutterable loneliness and desertion. Until
this moment he has been sustained by the buoyancy of
anticipated success, the excitement of change, the enlivening
influences of new and beautiful scenes; and the effect
of strange faces and strange customs has been to divert the
attention, while the farewell pressure of affection yet has
warmly lingered. All this is over now, and his spirit, left
to its own resources, sinks within him. The sacred spot
of his nativity is far, far away towards the morning sun;
and there is the village church and the village graveyard,
hallowed by many a holy remembrance; there, too, are
the playmates and the scenes of his boyhood-days; the trysting-place
of youthful love and of youthful friendship, spots
around which are twined full many a tendril of his heart;
and he has turned from them all <i>for ever</i>. Henceforth he
is a wanderer, and a distant soil must [57] claim his ashes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
He who, with such reflections, yearns not for the home of
his fathers, is an alien, and no true son of New-England.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the morning of our first day upon the
Mississippi that we found ourselves beneath the stately
bluff upon which stands the old village of Cape Girardeau.<a name="FNanchor_51_53" id="FNanchor_51_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_53" class="fnanchor">51</a>
Its site is a bold bank of the stream, gently sloping to the
water's edge, upon a substratum of limerock. A settlement
was commenced on this spot in the latter part of the last
century. Its founders were of French and German extraction,
though its structures do not betray their origin. The
great earthquakes of 1811, which vibrated through the whole
length of the Western Valley, agitated the site of this village
severely; many brick houses were shattered, chimneys
thrown down, and other damage effected, traces of the
repairs of which are yet to be viewed. The place received
a shock far more severe, however, in the removal of the seat
of justice to another town in the county: but the landing is
an excellent one; iron ore and other minerals are its staples
of trade, and it is again beginning to assume a commercial
character. The most remarkable objects which struck
our attention in passing this place were several of those
peculiarly novel mills put in motion by a spiral water-wheel,
acted on by the current of the river. These screw-wheels
float upon the surface parallel to the shore, rising or falling
with the water, and are connected with the gearing in the
millhouse upon the bank by a long shaft. The action of
the current upon [58] the spiral thread of the wheel within
its external casing keeps it in constant motion, which is
communicated by the shaft to the machinery of the mills.
The contrivance betrays much ingenuity, and for purposes
where a <i>motive</i> of inconsiderable power is required, may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
useful; but for driving heavy millstones or a saw, the utility
is more than problematical.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Cape Girardeau commences what is
termed the "Tyowapity Bottom," a celebrated section of
country extending along the Missouri side of the stream some
thirty miles, and abounding with a peculiar species of potter's
clay, unctuous in its nature, exceedingly pure and white,
and plastic under the wheel.<a name="FNanchor_52_54" id="FNanchor_52_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_54" class="fnanchor">52</a> This stratum of clay is said
to vary from one foot to ten in depth, resting upon sandstone,
and covered by limestone abounding in petrifactions.
A manufactory is in operation at Cape Girardeau, in which
this substance is the material employed. Near the northern
extremity of this bottom the waters of the Muddy River enter
the Mississippi from Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_53_55" id="FNanchor_53_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_55" class="fnanchor">53</a> This stream was discovered
by the early French voyageurs, and from them received
the name of <i>Rivi&egrave;re au Vase</i>, or <i>Vaseux</i>. It is distinguished
for the salines upon its banks, for its exhaustless beds of
bituminous coal, for the fertility of the soil, and for a singularly-formed
eminence among the bluffs of the Mississippi,
a few miles from its mouth. Its name is "<i>Fountain Bluff</i>,"
derived from the circumstance that from its base gush out
a number of limpid springs.<a name="FNanchor_54_56" id="FNanchor_54_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_56" class="fnanchor">54</a> It is said to measure eight
miles [59] in circumference, and to have an altitude of several
hundred feet. Its western declivity looks down upon
the river, and its northern side is a precipitous crag, while that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
upon the south slopes away to a fertile plain, sprinkled with
farms.</p>

<p>A few miles above the Big Muddy stands out from the
Missouri shore a huge perpendicular column of limestone,
of cylindrical formation, about one hundred feet in circumference
at the base, and in height one hundred and fifty feet,
called the "Grand Tower."<a name="FNanchor_55_57" id="FNanchor_55_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_57" class="fnanchor">55</a> Upon its summit rests a thin
stratum of vegetable mould, supporting a shaggy crown of
rifted cedars, rocking in every blast that sweeps the stream,
whose turbid current boils, and chafes, and rages at the
obstruction below. This is the first of that celebrated range
of heights upon the Mississippi usually pointed out to the
tourist, springing in isolated masses from the river's brink
upon either side, and presenting to the eye a succession of
objects singularly grotesque. There are said to exist, at this
point upon the Mississippi, indications of a huge parapet
of limestone having once extended across the stream, which
must have formed a tremendous cataract, and effectually
inundated all the alluvion above. At low stages of the
water ragged shelves, which render the navigation dangerous,
are still to be seen. Among the other cliffs along this
precipitous range which have received names from the boatmen
are the "Devil's Oven," "Teatable," "Backbone,"
&amp;c., which, with the "Devil's Anvil," "Devil's Island," &amp;c.,
indicate pretty plainly the divinity most religiously propitiated
[60] in these dangerous passes.<a name="FNanchor_56_58" id="FNanchor_56_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_58" class="fnanchor">56</a> The "Oven"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
consists of an enormous promontory of rock, about one
hundred feet from the surface of the river, with a hemispherical
orifice scooped out of its face, probably by the
action, in ages past, of the whirling waters now hurrying
on below. It is situated upon the left bank of the stream,
about one mile above the "Tower," and is visible from the
river. In front rests a huge fragment of the same rock,
and in the interval stands a dwelling and a garden spot.
The "Teatable" is situated at some distance below, and
the other spots named are yet lower upon the stream.
This whole region bears palpable evidence of having been
subjected, ages since, to powerful volcanic and diluvial
action; and neither the Neptunian or Vulcanian theory can
advance a superior claim.</p>

<p>For a long time after entering the dangerous defile in
the vicinity of the <i>Grand Tower</i>, through which the current
rushes like a racehorse, our steamer writhed and groaned
against the torrent, hardly advancing a foot. At length,
as if by a single tremendous effort, which caused her to
quiver and vibrate to her centre, an onward impetus was
gained, the boat shot forward, the rapids were overcome,
and then, by chance, commenced one of those perilous
feats of rivalry, formerly, more than at present, frequent
upon the Western waters, <span class="smcap">a race</span>. Directly before us, a
steamer of a large class, deeply laden, was roaring and
struggling against the torrent under her highest pressure.
During our passage we had several times passed and
repassed each other, as either boat was delayed [61] at the
various woodyards along the route; but now, as the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
came on, and we found ourselves gaining upon our antagonist,
the excitement of emulation flushed every cheek.
The passengers and crew hung clustering, in breathless
interest, upon the galleries and the boiler deck, wherever
a post for advantageous view presented; while the hissing
valves, the quick, heavy stroke of the piston, the sharp
clatter of the <i>eccentric</i>, and the cool determination of the
pale engineer, as he glided like a spectre among the fearful
elements of destruction, gave evidence that the challenge
was accepted. But there was one humble individual, above
all others, whose whole soul seemed concentrated in the
contest, as from time to time, in the intervals of toil, his
begrimed and working features were caught, glaring through
the lurid light of the furnaces he was feeding. This was no
less a personage than the doughty fireman of our steamer;
a long, lanky individual, with a cute cast of the eye, a knowing
tweak of the nose, and an interminable longitude of phiz.
His checkered shirt was drenched with perspiration; a huge
pair of breeches, begirdling his loins by means of a leathern
belt, covered his nether extremities, and two sinewy arms
of "whipcord and bone" held in suspension a spadelike
brace of hands. During our passage, more than once did
I avail myself of an opportunity of studying the grotesque,
good-humoured visage of this <i>unique</i> individual; and it required
no effort of fancy to imagine I viewed before me
some lingering remnant of that "horse and alligator
race," now, like [62] the poor Indian, fast fading from the
West before the march of steamboats and civilization, <i>videlicet</i>,
"the Mississippi boatman." And, on the occasion of
which I speak, methought I could catch no slight resemblance
in my interesting fireman, as he flourished his ponderous
limbs, to that faithful portraiture of his majesty of the
Styx in Tooke's Pantheon! though, as touching this latter,
I must confess me of much dubiety in boyhood days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with the worthy "gravedigger" Young, having entertained
shrewd suspicions whether the "tyrant ever sat."</p>

<p>But in my zeal for the honest Charon I am forgetting
the exciting subject of the race. During my digression, the
ambitious steamers have been puffing, and sweating, and
glowing in laudable effort, to say nothing of stifled sobs said
to have issued from their labouring bosoms, until at length
a grim smile of satisfaction lighting up the rugged features
of the worthy Charon, gave evidence that not in vain he had
wielded his mace or heaved his wood. A dense mist soon
after came on, and the exhausted steamers were hauled up
at midnight beneath the venerable trees upon the banks of the
stream. On the first breakings of dawn all was again in
motion. But, alas! alas! in spite of all the strivings of our
valorous steamer, it soon became but too evident that her
mighty rival must prevail, as with distended jaws, like to
some huge fish, she came rushing up in our wake, as if our
annihilation were sure. But our apprehensions proved
groundless; like a civil, well-behaved rival, she speeded on,
hurling forth a triple bob-major of [63] curses at us as
she passed, doubtless by way of salvo, and disappeared
behind a point. When to this circumstance is added that
a long-winded racer of a mail-boat soon after swept past
us in her onward course, and left us far in the rear, I shall
be believed when it is stated that the steamer on which we
were embarked was distinguished for anything but speed;
a circumstance by none regretted <i>less</i> than by myself.</p>

<p>But a very few years have passed away since the navigation
of the Mississippi was that of one of the most dangerous
streams on the globe; but, thanks to the enterprising
genius of the scientific Shreve, this may no longer with
truth be said. In 1824 the first appropriation<a name="FNanchor_57_59" id="FNanchor_57_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_59" class="fnanchor">57</a> was voted
by Congress for improving the navigation of the Western
rivers; and since that period thousands of snags, sawyers,
[64] planters, sand-bars, sunken rocks, and fallen trees have
been removed, until all that now remains is to prevent new
obstacles from accumulating where the old have been
eradicated. For much of its course in its lower sections,
the Mississippi is now quite safe; and as the progress of
settlements advances upon its banks, the navigation of this
noble stream will doubtless become unobstructed in its
whole magnificent journey from the falls of the "Laughing
Water" to the Mexican Gulf. The indefatigable industry,
the tireless perseverance, the indomitable enterprise, and the
enlarged and scientific policy of Captain Shreve, the projector
and accomplisher of the grand national operations
upon the Western rivers, can never be estimated beyond
their merit. The execution of that gigantic undertaking, the
removal of the Red River Raft, has identified his history
with that of the empire West;<a name="FNanchor_58_60" id="FNanchor_58_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_60" class="fnanchor">58</a> his fame will endure so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
as those magnificent streams, with which his name is associated,
shall continue to roll on their volumed waters to the deep.</p>

<p>These remarks have been suggested by scenes of constant
recurrence to the traveller on the Mississippi. The banks,
the forests, the islands all differ as much as the stream
itself from those of the soft-gliding Ohio. Instead of those
dense emerald masses of billowy foliage swelling gracefully
up from the banks of "the beautiful river," those of the
Mississippi throw back a rough, ragged outline; their sands
piled with logs and uprooted trees, while heaps of wreck
and drift-wood betray the wild ravages of the stream. In
the midst of [65] the mass a single enormous sycamore often
rears its ghastly limbs, while at its foot springs gracefully
up a light fringe of the pensile willow. Sometimes, too, a
huge sawyer, clinging upon the verge of the channel, heaves
up its black mass above the surface, then falls, and again
rises with the rush of the current. Against one of these
sawyers is sometimes lodged a mass of drift-wood, pressing
it firmly upon the bottom, till, by a constant accumulation,
a foundation is gradually laid and a new island is formed:
this again, by throwing the water from its course, causes
a new channel, which, infringing with violence upon the
opposite bank, undermines it with its colonnade of enormous
trees, and thus new material in endless succession is
afforded for obstructions to the navigation. The deposites
of alluvion along the banks betray a similar origin of
gradual accumulation by the annual floods. In some
sections of the American Bottom,<a name="FNanchor_59_61" id="FNanchor_59_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_61" class="fnanchor">59</a> commencing at its
southern extremity with the Kaskaskia River, the mould,
upward of thirty feet in depth, is made up of numerous
strata of earth, which may be readily distinguished and
counted by the colours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>About twenty miles above the mouth of the Kaskaskia
is situated Ste. Genevieve, grand deposite of the lead of the
celebrated ancient mines <i>La Motte</i>, and <i>A'Burton</i>, and
others, some thirty miles in the interior, and the market
which supplies all the mining district of the vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_60_62" id="FNanchor_60_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_62" class="fnanchor">60</a> It
was first commenced about the year 1774 by the original
settlers of Upper Louisiana; and the Canadian [66] French,
with their descendants, constitute a large portion of its present
inhabitants. The population does not now exceed eight
hundred, though it is once said to have numbered two
thousand inhabitants. Some of the villagers are advanced
in years, and among them is M. Valle, one of the chief
proprietors of <i>Mine la Motte</i>, who, though now some ninety
years of age, is almost as active as when fifty.<a name="FNanchor_61_63" id="FNanchor_61_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_63" class="fnanchor">61</a> Ste. Gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>vieve
is situated about one mile from the Mississippi, upon a
broad alluvial plain lying between the branches of a
small stream called <i>Gabourie</i>. Beyond the first bottom rises
a second steppe, and behind this yet a third, attaining an
elevation of more than a hundred feet from the water's edge.
Upon this elevated site was erected, some twenty years since,
a handsome structure of stone, commanding a noble prospect
of the river, the broad American Bottom on the opposite
side, and the bluffs beyond the Kaskaskia. It was intended
for a literary institution; but, owing to unfavourable reports
with regard to the health of its situation, the design was
abandoned, and the edifice was never completed. It is now
in a state of "ruinous perfection," and enjoys the reputation,
moreover, of being <i>haunted</i>. In very sooth, its aspect,
viewed from the river at twilight, with its broken windows
outlined against the western sky, is wild enough to warrant
such an idea or any other. A courthouse and Catholic
chapel constitute the public buildings. To the south of the
village, and lying upon the river, is situated the common
field, originally comprising [67] two thousand <i>arpens</i>; but it
is now much less in extent, and is yearly diminishing from
the action of the current upon the alluvial banks. These
common fields were granted by the Spanish government,
as well as by the French, to every village settled under their
domination. A single enclosure at the expense of the villagers
was erected and kept in repair, and the lot of every
individual was separated from his neighbour's by a double
furrow. Near this field the village was formerly located;
but in the inundation of 1785, called by the old <i>habitans</i>
"<i>L'annee des grandes eaux</i>," so much of the bank was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
washed away that the settlers were forced to select a more
elevated site. The Mississippi was at this time swelled
to thirty feet above the highest water-mark before known;
and the town of Kaskaskia and the whole American Bottom
were inundated.</p>

<p>Almost every description of minerals are to be found in
the county, of which Ste. Genevieve is the seat of justice.
But of all other species, iron ore is the most abundant.
The celebrated <i>Iron Mountain</i> and the <i>Pilot Knob</i> are but
forty miles distant.<a name="FNanchor_62_64" id="FNanchor_62_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_64" class="fnanchor">62</a> Abundance of coal is found in the
opposite bluffs in Illinois. About twelve miles from the
village has been opened a quarry of beautiful white marble,
in some respects thought not inferior to that of Carrara.
There are also said to be immense caves of pure white
sand, of dazzling lustre, quantities of which are transported
to Pittsburg for the manufacture of flint glass. There are a
number of beautiful fountains in the neighbourhood, one of
which is said to be of surpassing loveliness. It is several
[68] yards square, and rushes up from a depth of fifteen
or twenty feet, enclosed upon three sides by masses of
living rock, over which, in pensile gracefulness, repose the
long glossy branches of the forest trees.</p>

<p>The early French settlers manufactured salt a few miles
from the village, at a saline formerly occupied by the aborigines,
the remains of whose earthen kettles are yet found on
the spot. About thirty years since a village of the Peoria
Indians was situated where the French common field now
stands;<a name="FNanchor_63_65" id="FNanchor_63_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_65" class="fnanchor">63</a> and from the ancient mounds found in the vicinity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and the vast quantities of animal and human remains, and
utensils of pottery exhumed from the soil, the spot seems
to have been a favourite location of a race whose destiny,
and origin, and history are alike veiled in oblivion. The
view of Ste. Genevieve from the water is picturesque and
beautiful, and its landing is said to be superior to any between
the mouth of the Ohio and the city of St. Louis. The
village has that decayed and venerable aspect characteristic
of all these early French settlements.</p>

<p>As we were passing Ste. Genevieve an accident occurred
which had nearly proved fatal to our boat, if not to the lives
of all on board of her. A race which took place between
another steamer and our own has been noticed. In some
unaccountable manner, this boat, which then passed us, fell
again in the rear, and now, for the last hour, had been
coming up in our wake under high steam. On overtaking
us, she attempted, contrary to all rules and regulations [69]
for the navigation of the river provided, to pass between
our boat and the bank beneath which we were moving; an
outrage which, had it been persisted in a moment longer
than was fortunately the case, would have sent us to the
bottom. For a single instant, as she came rushing on, contact
seemed inevitable; and, as her force was far superior
to our own, and the recklessness of many who have the
guidance of Western steamers was well known to us all, the
passengers stood clustering around upon the decks, some
pale with apprehension, and others with firearms in their
hands, flushed with excitement, and prepared to render back
prompt retribution on the first aggression. The pilot of the
hostile boat, from his exposed situation and the virulent
feelings against him, would have met with certain death;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and he, consequently, contrary to the express injunctions
of the master, reversed the motion of the wheels just at the
instant to avoid the fatal encounter. The sole cause for
this outrage, we subsequently learned, was a private pique
existing between the pilots of the respective steamers. One
cannot restrain an expression of indignant feeling at such
an exhibition of foolhardy recklessness. It is strange, after
all the fearful accidents of this description upon the Western
waters, and that terrible prodigality of human life which
for years past has been constantly exhibited, there should
yet be found individuals so utterly regardless of the safety
of their fellow-men, and so destitute of every emotion of
generous feeling, as to force their way heedlessly onward
into [70] danger, careless of any issue save the paltry gratification
of private vengeance. It is a question daily
becoming of more startling import, How may these fatal
occurrences be successfully opposed? Where lies the fault?
Is it in public sentiment? Is it in legal enactment? Is it in
individual villany? However this may be, our passage
seemed fraught with adventure, of which this is but an
incident. After the event mentioned, having composed the
agitation consequent, we had retired to our berths, and were
just buried in profound sleep, when crash&mdash;our boat's bow
struck heavily against a snag, which, glancing along the
bottom, threw her at once upon her beams, and all the passengers
on the elevated side from their berths. No serious
injury was sustained, though alarm and confusion enough
were excited by such an unceremonious turn-out. The
dismay and tribulation of some of our worthy company
were entirely too ludicrous for the risibles of the others, and
a hearty roar of cachinnation was heard even above the
ejaculations of distress; a very improper thing, no doubt,
and not at all to be recommended on such occasions, as
one would hardly wish to make a grave "unknell'd and un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>coffin'd"
in the Mississippi, with a broad grin upon his
phiz.</p>

<p>In alluding to the race which took place during our passage,
honourable mention was made of a certain worthy
individual whose vocation was to feed the furnaces; and
one bright morning, when all the others of our company
had bestowed themselves in their berths because of the intolerable
[71] heat, I took occasion to visit the sooty Charon
in the purgatorial realms over which he wielded the sceptre.
"Grievous work this building fires under a sun like that,"
was the salutation, as my friend the fireman had just
completed the toilsome operation once more of stuffing the
furnace, while floods of perspiration were coursing down a
chest hairy as Esau's in the Scripture, and as brawny. Hereupon
honest Charon lifted up his face, and drawing a dingy
shirt sleeve with emphasis athwart his eyes, bleared with
smut, responded, "Ay, ay, sir; it's a sin to Moses, such a
trade;" and seizing incontinently upon a fragment of tin,
fashioned by dint of thumping into a polygonal dipper of
unearthly dimensions, he scooped up a quantity of the turbid
fluid through which we were moving, and deep, deep
was the potation which, like a succession of rapids, went
gurgling down his throat. Marvellously refreshed, the
worthy genius dilated, much to my edification, upon the
glories of a fireman's life. "Upon this hint I spake" touching
the topic of our recent race; and then were the strings
of the old worthy's tongue let loose; and vehemently amplified
he upon "our smart chance of a gallop" and "the
slight sprinkling of steam he had managed to push up."
"Ah, stranger, I'll allow, and couldn't I have teetotally
obfusticated her, and right mightily used her up, hadn't it
been I was sort of bashful as to keeping path with such
a cursed old mud-turtle! But it's all done gone;" and
the droughty Charon seized another swig from the un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>earthly
dipper; and closing hermetically his lantern jaws,
and resuming his <i>infernal</i> [72] labours, to which those of
Alcmena's son or of Tartarean Sysiphus were trifles, I had
the discretion to betake myself to the upper world.</p>

<p>During the night, after passing Ste. Genevieve, our steamer
landed at a woodyard in the vicinity of that celebrated old
fortress, Fort Chartres, erected by the French while in possession
of Illinois; once the most powerful fortification in
North America, but now a pile of ruins.<a name="FNanchor_64_66" id="FNanchor_64_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_66" class="fnanchor">64</a> It is situated about
three miles from <i>Prairie de Rocher</i>, a little antiquated French
hamlet, the scene of one of Hall's Western Legends.<a name="FNanchor_65_67" id="FNanchor_65_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_67" class="fnanchor">65</a> We
could see nothing of the old fort from our situation on the
boat; but its vast ruins, though now a shattered heap, and
shrouded with forest-trees of more than half a century's
growth, are said still to proclaim in their finished and ponderous
masonry its ancient grandeur and strength. In front
stretches a large island in the stream, which has received
from the old ruin a name. It is not a little surprising that
there exists no description of this venerable pile worthy its
origin and eventful history.</p>

<p>There are few objects upon the Mississippi in which
the geologist and natural philosopher may claim a deeper
interest than that singular series of limestone cliffs already
alluded to, which, above its junction with the Ohio, present
themselves to the traveller all along the Missouri shore. The
principal ridge commences a few miles above Ste. Genevieve;
and at sunrise one morning we found ourselves beneath
a huge battlement of crags, rising precipitously from
the river to the height of several hundred feet. Seldom have
I gazed upon a scene more eminently imposing than that
of these hoary old cliffs, when the midsummer-sun, rushing
upward from the eastern horizon, bathed their splintered
pinnacles and spires and the rifted tree-tops in a flood of
golden effulgence. The scene was not unworthy Walter
Scott's graphic description of the view from the Trosachs
of Loch Katrine, in the "Lady of the Lake:"</p>

<p class="noidt">[74] All of these precipices, not less than those on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Ohio, betray palpable indication of having once been swept
by the stream; and the fantastic excavations and cavernous
fissures which their bold escarpments expose would indicate
a current far more furious and headstrong than that,
resistless though it be, which now rolls at their base. The
idea receives confirmation from the circumstance that opposite
extends the broad American Bottom, whose alluvial
character is undisputed. This tract once constituted our
western border, whence the name.</p>

<p>The bluffs of Selma and Herculaneum are distinguished
for their beauty and grandeur, not less than for the practical
utility to which they have been made subservient. Both
places are great depositories of lead from the mines of the
interior, and all along their cliffs, for miles, upon every
eligible point, are erected tall towers for the manufacture
of shot. Their appearance in distant view is singularly
picturesque, perched lightly upon the pinnacles of towering
cliffs, beetling over the flood, which rushes along two hundred
feet below. Some of these shot manufactories have
been in operation [75] for nearly thirty years.<a name="FNanchor_66_68" id="FNanchor_66_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_68" class="fnanchor">66</a> Herculaneum
has long been celebrated for those in her vicinity.
The situation of the town is the mouth of Joachim Creek;
and the singular gap at this point has been aptly compared
to an enormous door, thrown open in the cliffs for the
passage of its waters. A few miles west of this village is
said to exist a great natural curiosity, in shape of a huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
rock of limestone, some hundred feet in length, and about
fifty feet high. This rock is completely honeycombed with
perforations, and has the appearance of having been pierced
by the mytilus or some other marine insect.</p>

<p>A few miles above Herculaneum comes in the Platine
Creek;<a name="FNanchor_67_69" id="FNanchor_67_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_69" class="fnanchor">67</a> and here commence the "Cornice Rocks," a magnificent
escarpment of castellated cliffs some two or three
hundred feet in perpendicular altitude from the bed of the
stream, and extending along the western bank a distance
of eight or ten miles. Through the fa&ccedil;ade of these bluffs
pours in the tribute of the Merrimac, a bright, sparkling,
beautiful stream.<a name="FNanchor_68_70" id="FNanchor_68_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_70" class="fnanchor">68</a> This river is so clear and limpid that it
was long supposed to glide over sands of silver; but the idea
has been abandoned, and given place to the certainty of an
abundant store of lead, and iron, and salt upon its banks,
while its source is shaded by extensive forests of the white
pine, a material in this section of country almost, if not
quite, as valuable.<a name="FNanchor_69_71" id="FNanchor_69_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_71" class="fnanchor">69</a> Ancient works of various forms are
also found upon the banks of the Merrimac. There is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
immense cemetery near the village of Fenton, containing
[76] thousands of graves of a pigmy size, the largest not
exceeding four feet in length. This cemetery is now enclosed
and cultivated, so that the graves are no longer visible; but,
previous to this, it is said that headstones were to be seen
bearing unintelligible hieroglyphical inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_70_72" id="FNanchor_70_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_72" class="fnanchor">70</a> Human
remains, ancient pottery, arrow-heads, and stone axes are
daily thrown up by the ploughshare, while the numerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
mounds in the vicinity are literally composed of the same
materials. Mammoth bones, such as those discovered on
the Ohio and in the state of New-York, are said also to
have been found at a salt-lick near this stream.</p>

<p>It was a bright morning, on the fifth day of an exceedingly
long passage, that we found ourselves approaching St. Louis.
At about noon we were gliding beneath the broad ensign
floating from the flagstaff of Jefferson Barracks.<a name="FNanchor_71_73" id="FNanchor_71_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_73" class="fnanchor">71</a> The sun
was gloriously bright; the soft summer wind was rippling
the waters, and the clear cerulean of the heavens was
imaged in their depths. The site of the quadrangle of
the barracks enclosing the parade is the broad summit of a
noble bluff, swelling up from the water, while the outbuildings
are scattered picturesquely along the interval beneath;
the view from the steamer cannot but strike the traveller as
one of much scenic beauty. Passing the venerable village of
Carondelet, with its whitewashed cottages crumbling with
years, and old Cahokia buried in the forests on the opposite
bank, the gray walls of the Arsenal next stood out before
us in the rear of its beautiful esplanade.<a name="FNanchor_72_74" id="FNanchor_72_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_74" class="fnanchor">72</a> A fine quay is
erected upon the river in front, and the extensive grounds
[77] are enclosed by a wall of stone. Sweeping onward,
the lofty spire and dusky walls of St. Louis Cathedral, on
rounding a river bend, opened upon the eye, the gilded cru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>cifix
gleaming in the sunlight from its lofty summit; and
then the glittering cupolas and church domes, and the fresh
aspect of private residences, mingling with the bright foliage
of forest-trees interspersed, all swelling gently from the
water's edge, recalled vividly the beautiful "Mistress of the
North," as my eye has often lingered upon her from her
magnificent bay. A few more spires, and the illusion would
be perfect. For beauty of outline in distant view, St. Louis
is deservedly famed. The extended range of limestone
warehouses circling the shore give to the city a grandeur
of aspect, as approached from the water, not often beheld;
while the dense-rolling forest-tops stretching away in the
rear, the sharp outline of the towers and roofs against the
western sky, and the funereal grove of steamboat-pipes lining
the quay, altogether make up a combination of features
novel and picturesque. As we approached the landing all
the uproar and confusion of a steamboat port was before
us, and our own arrival added to the bustle.</p>

<p>And now, perchance, having escaped the manifold perils
of sawyer and snag, planter, wreck-heap, and sand-bar, it
may not be unbecoming in me, like an hundred other tourists,
to gather up a votive offering, and&mdash;if classic allusion
be permissible on the waters of the wilderness West&mdash;hang
it up before the shrine of the "Father of Floods."</p>

<p>[78] It is surely no misnomer that this giant stream has
been styled the "eternal river," the "terrible Mississippi;"<a name="FNanchor_73_75" id="FNanchor_73_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_75" class="fnanchor">73</a>
for we may find none other imbodying so many elements
of the fearful and the sublime. In the wild rice-lakes of
the far frozen north, amid a solitude broken only by the
shrill clang of the myriad water-fowls, is its home. Gushing
out from its fountains clear as the air-bell, it sparkles
over the white pebbly sand-beds, and, breaking over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
beautiful falls of the "Laughing Water,"<a name="FNanchor_74_76" id="FNanchor_74_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_76" class="fnanchor">74</a> it takes up its
majestic march to the distant deep. Rolling onward through
the shades of magnificent forests, and hoary, castellated cliffs,
and beautiful meadows, its volume is swollen as it advances,
until it receives to its bosom a tributary, a rival, a conqueror,
which has roamed three thousand miles for the meeting, and
its original features are lost for ever. Its beauty is merged
in sublimity! Pouring along in its deep bed the heaped-up
waters of streams which drain the broadest valley on the
globe; sweeping onward in a boiling mass, furious, turbid,
always dangerous; tearing away, from time to time, its deep
banks, with their giant colonnades of living verdure, and
then, with the stern despotism of a conqueror, flinging them
aside again; governed by no principle but its own lawless will,
the dark majesty of its features summons up an emotion of
the sublime which defies contrast or parallel. And then,
when we think of its far, lonely course, journeying onward in
proud, dread, solitary grandeur, [79] through forests dusk
with the lapse of centuries, pouring out the ice and snows
of arctic lands through every temperature of clime, till at
last it heaves free its mighty bosom beneath the Line, we
are forced to yield up ourselves in uncontrolled admiration
of its gloomy magnificence. And its dark, mysterious history,
too; those fearful scenes of which it has alone been
the witness; the venerable tombs of a race departed which
shadow its waters; the savage tribes that yet roam its forests;
the germes of civilization expanding upon its borders; and
the deep solitudes, untrodden by man, through which it
rolls, all conspire to throng the fancy. Ages on ages and
cycles upon cycles have rolled away; wave after wave has
swept the broad fields of the Old World; an hundred generations
have arisen from the cradle and flourished in their
freshness, and, like autumn leaflets, have withered in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
tomb; and the Pharaohs and the Ptolemies, the C&aelig;sars
and the Caliphs, have thundered over the nations and
passed away; and here, amid these terrible solitudes, in
the stern majesty of loneliness, and power, and pride,
have rolled onward these deep waters to their destiny!</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no stream which presents a greater
variety of feature than the Mississippi, or phenomena of
deeper interest, whether we regard the soil, productions,
and climate of its valley, its individual character and that
of its tributaries, or [80] the outline of its scenery and
course. The confluents of this vast stream are numerous,
and each one brings a tribute of the soil through which
it has roamed. The Missouri pours out its waters heavily
charged with the marl of the Rocky Mountains, the saffron
sands of the Yellow Stone, and the chalk of the White
River; the Ohio holds in its floods the vegetable mould
of the Alleghanies, and the Arkansas and Red Rivers
bring in the deep-died alluvion of their banks. Each
tributary mingles the spoils of its native hills with the
general flood. And yet, after the contributions of so many
streams, the remarkable fact is observed that its breadth
and volume seem rather diminished than increased.<a name="FNanchor_75_77" id="FNanchor_75_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_77" class="fnanchor">75</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Above the embouchure of the Missouri, fifteen hundred
miles from the Mexican gulf, it is broader than at New-Orleans,
with scarce one tenth of its waters; and at the
foot of St. Anthony's Falls its breadth is but one third less.
This forms a striking characteristic of the Western rivers,
and owes, perhaps, its origin partially to the turbid character
of their waters: as they approach their outlet they
augment in volume, and depth, and impetuosity of current,
but contract their expanse. None, however, exhibit
these features so strikingly as the grand central stream;
and while, for its body of water, it is the narrowest stream
known, it is charged with heavier solutions and has broader
alluvions than any other. The depth of the stream is constantly
varying. At New-Orleans it exceeds one hundred
feet. Its width is from half of one mile to two miles; the
breadth of its valley [81] from six miles to sixty; the rapidity
of its current from two miles to four; its mean descent
six inches in a mile, and its annual floods vary from twelve
feet to sixty, commencing in March and ending in May.
Thus much for Statistics.</p>

<p>Below its confluence with its turbid tributary, the Mississippi,
as has been observed, is no longer the clear, pure,
limpid stream, gushing forth from the wreathy snows of the
Northwest; but it whirls along against its ragged banks a
resistless volume of heavy, sweeping floods, and its aspect
of placid magnificence is beheld no more. The turbid torrent
heaves onward, wavering from side to side like a living
creature, as if to overleap its bounds; rolling along in a deep-cut
race-path, through a vast expanse of lowland meadow,
from whose exhaustless mould are reared aloft those enormous
shafts shrouded in the fresh emerald of their tasselled
parasites, for which its alluvial bottoms are so famous. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
yet the valley of the "endless river" cannot be deemed
heavily timbered when contrasted with the forested hills
of the Ohio. The sycamore, the elm, the linden, the cotton-wood,
the cypress, and other trees of deciduous foliage, may
attain a greater diameter, but the huge trunks are more
sparse and more isolated in recurrence.</p>

<p>But one of the most striking phenomena of the Mississippi,
in common with all the Western rivers, and one which
distinguishes them from those which disembogue their waters
into the Atlantic, is the uniformity of its meanderings.
The river, in its onward course, makes a semicircular sweep
almost [82] with the precision of a compass, and then is
precipitated diagonally athwart its channel to a curve of
equal regularity upon the opposite shore. The deepest channel
and most rapid current is said to exist in the bend;
and thus the stream generally infringes upon the <i>bend-side</i>,
and throws up a sandbar on the shore opposite. So constantly
do these sinuosities recur, that there are said to be
but three <i>reaches</i> of any extent between the confluence of the
Ohio and the Gulf, and so uniform that the boatmen and
Indians have been accustomed to estimate their progress by
the number of bends rather than by the number of miles.
One of the sweeps of the Missouri is said to include a distance
of forty miles in its curve, and a circuit of half that
distance is not uncommon. Sometimes a "<i>cut-off</i>," in the
parlance of the watermen, is produced at these bends,
where the stream, in its headlong course, has burst through
the narrow neck of the peninsula, around which it once
circled. At a point called the "Grand Cut-off," steamers
now pass through an isthmus of less than one mile, where
formerly was required a circuit of twenty. The current, in
its more furious stages, often tears up islands from the bed
of the river, removes sandbars and points, and sweeps off
whole acres of alluvion with their superincumbent forests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
In the season of flood the settlers, in their log-cabins along
the banks, are often startled from their sleep by the deep,
sullen crash of a "land-slip," as such removals are called.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Mississippi, below its confluence [83]
with the Missouri, is, as has been remarked, too sublime
for beauty; and yet there is not a little of the picturesque
in the views which meet the eye along the banks. Towns
and settlements of greater or less extent appear at frequent
intervals; and then the lowly log-hut of the pioneer is not
to be passed without notice, standing beneath the tall, branchless
columns of the girdled forest-trees, with its luxuriant
maize-fields sweeping away in the rear. One of these humble
habitations of the wilderness we reached, I remember,
one evening near twilight; and while our boat was delayed
at the woodyard, I strolled up from the shore to the gateway,
and entered easily into confabulation with a pretty,
slatternly-looking female, with a brood of mushroom, flaxen-haired
urchins at her apron-string, and an infant at the
breast very quietly receiving his supper. On inquiry I
learned that eighteen years had seen the good woman a
denizen of the wilderness; that all the responsibilities
appertained unto herself, and that her "man" was proprietor
of some thousand acres of <i>bottom</i> in the vicinity.
Subsequently I was informed that the worthy woodcutter
could be valued at not less than one hundred thousand!
yet, <i>en verite</i>, reader mine, I do asseverate that my latent
sympathies were not slightly roused at the first introduction,
because of the seeming poverty of the dirty cabin
and its dirtier mistress!</p>

<p>A bright, sunny summer morning as ever smiled from
the blue heavens, and again I found myself upon the
waters. Fast fading in the distance lay the venerable little
city of the French, with its ancient edifices and its narrow
streets, while in anticipation was a journeying of some hundred
miles up the Illinois. Sweeping along past the city and
the extended line of steamers at the landing, my attention
was arrested by that series of substantial stone mills situated
upon the shore immediately above, and a group of swarthy
little Tritons disporting themselves in the turbid waters
almost beneath our paddle-wheels. Among other singular
objects were divers of those nondescript inventions of
Captain Shreve, yclept by the boatmen "Uncle Sam's
Tooth-pullers;" and, judging from their ferocious physiognomy,
and the miracles they have effected in the navigation
of the great waters of the West, well do they correspond to
the <i>soubriquet</i>. [85] The craft consists of two perfect hulls,
constructed with a view to great strength; united by heavy
beams, and, in those parts most exposed, protected by an
armature of iron. The apparatus for eradicating the snags
is comprised in a simple wheel and axle, auxiliary to a pair
of powerful steam-engines, with the requisite machinery for
locomotion, and a massive beam uniting the bows of the
hulls, sheathed with iron. The <i>modus operandi</i> in tearing
up a snag, or sawyer, or any like obstruction from the bed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of the stream, appears to be this: Commencing at some distance
below, in order to gain an impetus as powerful as
possible, the boat is forced, under a full pressure of steam,
against the snag, the head of which, rearing itself above the
water, meets the strong transverse beam of which I have
spoken, and is immediately elevated a number of feet above
the surface. A portion of the log is then severed, and the
roots are torn out by the windlass, or application of the main
strength of the engines; or, if practicable, the first operation
is repeated until the obstacle is completely eradicated. The
efficiency of this instrument has been tested by the removal
of some thousand obstructions, at an average expense of
about twelve or fifteen dollars each.</p>

<p>Along the river-banks in the northern suburbs of the city
lie the scattered ruins of an ancient fortification of the Spanish
government, when it held domination over the territory;
and one circular structure of stone, called "Roy's Tower,"
now occupied as a dwelling, yet remains entire. There is
also an [86] old castle of stone in tolerable preservation,
surrounded by a wall of the same material.<a name="FNanchor_76_78" id="FNanchor_76_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_78" class="fnanchor">76</a> Some of these
venerable relics of former time&mdash;alas! for the irreverence
of the age&mdash;have been converted into limekilns, and into
lime itself, for aught that is known to the contrary! The
waterworks, General Ashley's beautiful residence, and that
series of ancient mounds for which St. Louis is famous, were
next passed in succession, while upon the right stretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
out the long low outline of "Blood Island" in the middle
of the stream.<a name="FNanchor_77_79" id="FNanchor_77_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_79" class="fnanchor">77</a> For several miles above the city, as we
proceeded up the river, pleasant villas, with their white walls
and cultivated grounds, were caught from time to time by
the eye, glancing through the green foliage far in the interior.
It was a glorious day. Silvery cloudlets were floating
along the upper sky like spiritual creations, and a fresh
breeze was rippling the waters: along the banks stood out
the huge spectral Titans of the forest, heaving aloft their
naked limbs like monuments of "time departed," while
beneath reposed the humble hut and clearing of the settler.</p>

<p>It was nearly midday, after leaving St. Louis, that we
reached the embouchure of the Missouri. Twenty miles
before attaining that point, the confluent streams flow along
in two distinct currents upon either shore, the one white,
clayey, and troubled, the other a deep blue. The river
sweeps along, indeed, in two distinct streams past the city
of St. Louis, upon either side of Blood Island, nor does it
unite its heterogeneous floods for many miles below. At
intervals, as the huge mass rolls itself [87] along, vast whirls
and swells of turbid water burst out upon the surface, producing
an aspect not unlike the sea in a gusty day, mottled
by the shadows of scudding clouds. Charlevoix,<a name="FNanchor_78_80" id="FNanchor_78_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_80" class="fnanchor">78</a> the chronicler
of the early French explorations in North America,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
with reference to this giant confluence, more than a century
since thus writes: "I believe this is the finest confluence in
the world. The two rivers are much of the same breadth,
each about half a league, but the Missouri is by far the most
rapid, and seems to enter the Mississippi like a conqueror,
through which it carries its white waves to the opposite shore
without mixing them. Afterward it gives its colour to the
Mississippi, which it never loses again, but carries quite down
to the sea." This account, with all due consideration for
the venerable historian, accords not precisely with the scene
of the confluence at the present day, at least not as it has
appeared to myself. The Missouri, indeed, rolls in its heavy
volume with the impetuosity and bearing of a "conqueror"
upon the tranquil surface of its rival; but entering, as it
does, at right angles, its waters are met in their headlong
course, and almost rolled back upon themselves for an instant
by the mighty momentum of the flood they strike.
This is manifested by, and accounts for, that well-defined
line of light mud-colour extending from bank to bank across
its mouth, bounded by the dark blue of the Upper Mississippi,
and flowing sluggishly along in a lengthened and
dingy stain, like a fringe upon the western shore. The
breadth of the embouchure is about one mile, and its [88]
channel lies nearly in the centre, bounded by vast sand-bars&mdash;sediment
of the waters&mdash;upon either side. The alluvial
deposites, with which it is heavily charged, accumulate also
in several islands near the confluence, while the rivers united
spread themselves out into an immense lake. As the steamer
glides along among these islands opposite the Missouri, the
scene with its associations is grand beyond description. Far
up the extended vista of the stream, upon a lofty bluff, stands
out a structure which marks the site of the ancient military
post of "Belle Fontaine;"<a name="FNanchor_79_81" id="FNanchor_79_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_81" class="fnanchor">79</a> while on the opposite bank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
stretching inland from the point heavily wooded, lies the
broad and beautiful prairie of the "Mamelles."<a name="FNanchor_80_82" id="FNanchor_80_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_82" class="fnanchor">80</a> Directly
fronting the confluence stand a range of heights upon the
Illinois shore, from the summit of which is spread out, like
a painting, one of the most extraordinary views in the world.</p>

<p>The Mississippi, above its junction with its turbid tributary,
is, as has been remarked, a clear, sparkling, beautiful
stream; now flashing in silvery brilliance over its white
sand-bars, then retreating far into the deep indentations
of its shady banks, and again spreading out its waters into
a tranquil, lakelike basin miles in extent, studded with
islets.</p>

<p>The far-famed village of Alton, situated upon the Illinois
shore a few miles above the confluence, soon rose before
us in the distance. When its multiform declivities shall have
been smoothed away by the hand of enterprise and covered
with handsome edifices, it will doubtless present a fine appearance
[89] from the water; as it now remains, its aspect
is rugged enough. The Penitentiary, a huge structure of
stone, is rather too prominent a feature in the scene. Indeed,
it is the first object which strikes the attention, and
reminds one of a gray old baronial castle of feudal days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
more than of anything else. The churches, of which there are
several, and the extensive warehouses along the shore, have
an imposing aspect, and offer more agreeable associations.
As we drew nigh to Alton, the fireman of our steamer deemed
proper, in testimonial of the dignity of our arrival, to let
off a certain rusty old swivel which chanced to be on board;
and to have witnessed the marvellous fashion in which this
important man&#339;uvre was executed by our worthies, would
have pardoned a smile on the visage of Heraclitus himself.
One lanky-limbed genius held a huge dipper of gunpowder;
another, seizing upon the extremity of a hawser, and severing
a generous fragment, made use thereof for wadding;
a third rammed home the charge with that fearful weapon
wherewith he poked the furnaces; while a fourth, honest
wight&mdash;all preparation being complete&mdash;advanced with a
shovel of glowing coals, which, poured upon the touchhole,
the old piece was briefly delivered of its charge, and the
woods, and shores, and welkin rang again to the roar.
If we made not our entrance into Alton with "pomp and
circumstance," it was surely the fault of any one but our
worthy fireman.</p>

<p>The site of Alton, at the confluence of three large and
navigable streams; its extensive back country [90] of great
fertility; the vast bodies of heavy timber on every side; its
noble quarries of stone; its inexhaustible beds of bituminous
coal only one mile distant, and its commodious landing, all
seem to indicate the design of Nature that here should arise
a populous and wealthy town. The place has been laid off
by its proprietors in liberal style; five squares have been
reserved for public purposes, with a promenade and landing,
and the corporate bounds extend two miles along the
river, and half a mile into the interior. Yet Alton, with all
its local and artificial advantages, is obnoxious to objections.
Its situation, in one section abrupt and precipitous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
while in another depressed and confined, and the extensive
alluvion lying between the two great rivers opposite, it is
believed, will always render it more or less unhealthy; and
its unenviable proximity to St. Louis will never cease to
retard its commercial advancement.</p>

<p>The <i>city</i> of Alton, as it is now styled by its charter, was
founded in the year 1818 by a gentleman who gave the place
his name;<a name="FNanchor_81_83" id="FNanchor_81_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_83" class="fnanchor">81</a> but, until within the six years past, it could
boast but few houses and little business. Its population
now amounts to several thousands, and its edifices for business,
private residence, or public convenience are large and
elegant structures. Its stone churches present an imposing
aspect to the visiter. The streets are from forty to eighty
feet in width, and extensive operations are in progress to
render the place as uniform as its site will admit. A contract
has been recently entered upon to construct a culvert over
the Little Piasa Creek, [91] which passes through the centre
of the town, upon which are to be extended streets. The
expense is estimated at sixty thousand dollars. The creek
issues from a celebrated fountain among the bluffs called
"Cave Spring." Alton is not a little celebrated for its liberal
contribution to the moral improvements of the day. To
mention but a solitary instance, a gentleman of the place
recently made a donation of ten thousand dollars for the
endowment of a female seminary at Monticello,<a name="FNanchor_82_84" id="FNanchor_82_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_84" class="fnanchor">82</a> a village
five miles to the north; and measures are in progress to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
carry the design into immediate execution. Two railroads
are shortly to be constructed from Alton; one to Springfield,
seventy miles distant, and the other to Mount Carmel on
the Wabash. The stock of each has been mostly subscribed,
and they cannot fail, when completed, to add much to the importance
of the places. Alton is also a <i>proposed</i> terminus
of two of the state railroads, and of the Cumberland Road.<a name="FNanchor_83_85" id="FNanchor_83_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_85" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>At Alton terminates the "American Bottom," and here
commences that singular series of green, grassy mounds,
rounding off the steep summits of the cliffs as they rise from
the water, which every traveller cannot but have noticed
and admired. It was a calm, beautiful evening when we
left the village; and, gliding beneath the magnificent bluffs,
held our way up the stream, breaking in upon its tranquil
surface, and rolling its waters upon either side in tumultuous
waves to the shore. The rich purple of departing day
was dying the western heavens; the light gauzy haze of twilight
was unfolding itself like a veil over the forest-tops;
"Maro's shepherd [92] star" was stealing timidly forth upon
the brow of night; the flashing fireflies along the underbrush
were beginning their splendid illuminations, and the mild
melody of a flute and a few fine voices floating over the
shadowy waters, lent the last touching to a scene of beauty.
A little French village, with its broad galleries, and steep
roofs, and venerable church, in a few miles appeared among
the underbrush on the left.<a name="FNanchor_84_86" id="FNanchor_84_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_86" class="fnanchor">84</a> Upon the opposite shore the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
bluffs began to assume a singular aspect, as if the solid mass
of limestone high up had been subjected to the excavation
of rushing waters. The cliffs elevated themselves from the
river's edge like a regular succession of enormous pillars,
rendered more striking by their ashy hue. This giant
colonnade&mdash;in some places exceeding an altitude of an
hundred feet, and exhibiting in its fa&ccedil;ade the openings of
several caves&mdash;extended along the stream until we reached
Grafton,<a name="FNanchor_85_87" id="FNanchor_85_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_87" class="fnanchor">85</a> at the mouth of the Illinois; the calm, beautiful,
ever-placid Illinois; beautiful now as on the day the enthusiast
voyageur first deemed it the pathway to a "paradise
upon earth." The moon was up, and her beams were resting
mellowly upon the landscape. Far away, even to the
blue horizon, the mirror-surface of the stream unfolded its
vistas to the eye; upon its bosom slumbered the bright
islets, like spirits of the waters, from whose clear depths
stood out the reflection of their forests, while to the left opened
upon the view a glimpse of the "Mamelle Prairie," rolling
its bright waves of verdure beneath the moonlight like a
field of fairy land. For an hour we gazed upon this
magnificent scene, and the bright [93] waves dashed in
sparkles from our bow, retreating in lengthened wake behind
us, until our steamer turned from the Mississippi, and
we were gliding along beneath the deep shadows of the
forested Illinois.</p>

<p>It is an idea which has more than once occurred to me,
while throwing together these hasty delineations of the beautiful
scenes through which, for the past few weeks, I have
been moving, that, by some, a disposition might be suspected
to tinge every outline indiscriminately with the "<i>coleur de
rose</i>." But as well might one talk of an exaggerated emotion
of the sublime on the table-rock of Niagara, or amid
the "snowy scalps" of Alpine scenery, or of a mawkish
sensibility to loveliness amid the purple glories of the
"<i>Campagna di Roma</i>," as of either, or of both combined,
in the noble "valley beyond the mountains." Nor is the
interest experienced [94] by the traveller for many of the spots
he passes confined to their scenic beauty. The associations
of by-gone times are rife in the mind, and the traditionary
legend of the events these scenes have witnessed yet lingers
among the simple forest-sons. I have mentioned that remarkable
range of cliffs commencing at Alton, and extending,
with but little interruption, along the left shore of the
Mississippi to the mouth of the Illinois. Through a deep,
narrow ravine in these bluffs flows a small stream called the
Piasa. The name is of aboriginal derivation, and, in the
idiom of the Illini, denotes "<i>The bird that devours men</i>."
Near the mouth of this little stream rises a bold, precipitous
bluff, and upon its smooth face, at an elevation seemingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
unattainable by human art, is graven the figure of an enormous
bird with extended pinions. This bird was by the
Indians called the "<i>Piasa</i>;" hence the name of the stream.
The tradition of the Piasa is said to be still extant, among
the tribes of the Upper Mississippi, and is thus related:<a name="FNanchor_86_88" id="FNanchor_86_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_88" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>"Many thousand moons before the arrival of the pale
faces, when the great megalonyx and mastodon, whose bones
are now thrown up, were still living in the land of the green
prairies, there existed a bird of such dimensions that he
could easily carry off in his talons a full-grown deer. Having
obtained a taste of human flesh, from that time he would
prey upon nothing else. He was as artful as he was powerful;
would dart suddenly and unexpectedly upon an Indian,
bear him off to one of the caves in the bluff, and devour
him. Hundreds of warriors attempted for years to destroy
him, but without success. [95] Whole villages were depopulated,
and consternation spread throughout all the tribes
of the Illini. At length <i>Owatoga</i>, a chief whose fame as a
warrior extended even beyond the great lakes, separating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
himself from the rest of his tribe, fasted in solitude for the
space of a whole moon, and prayed to the Great Spirit, the
Master of Life, that he would protect his children from the
<i>Piasa</i>. On the last night of his fast the Great Spirit appeared
to him in a dream, and directed him to select twenty
of his warriors, each armed with a bow and pointed arrows,
and conceal them in a designated spot. Near the place of
their concealment another warrior was to stand in open view
as a victim for the <i>Piasa</i>, which they must shoot the instant he
pounced upon his prey. When the chief awoke in the morning
he thanked the Great Spirit, returned to his tribe, and told
them his dream. The warriors were quickly selected and
placed in ambush. <i>Owatoga</i> offered himself as the victim,
willing to die for his tribe; and, placing himself in open view of
the bluff, he soon saw the <i>Piasa</i> perched on the cliff, eying
his prey. <i>Owatoga</i> drew up his manly form to its utmost
height; and, placing his feet firmly upon the earth, began
to chant the death-song of a warrior: a moment after, the
<i>Piasa</i> rose in the air, and, swift as a thunderbolt, darted
down upon the chief. Scarcely had he reached his victim
when every bow was sprung and every arrow was sped to
the feather into his body. The <i>Piasa</i> uttered a wild, fearful
scream, that resounded far over the opposite side of the
river, and expired. <i>Owatoga</i> was safe. [96] Not an arrow,
not even the talons of the bird had touched him; for the
Master of Life, in admiration of his noble deed, had held
over him an invisible shield. In memory of this event, this
image of the Piasa was engraved in the face of the bluff."</p>

<p>Such is the Indian tradition. True or false, the figure
of the bird, with expanded wings, graven upon the surface
of solid rock, is still to be seen at a height perfectly inaccessible;
and to this day no Indian glides beneath the spot in
his canoe without discharging at this figure his gun. Connected
with this tradition, as the spot to which the Piasa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
conveyed his human victims, is one of those caves to which
I have alluded. Another, near the mouth of the Illinois,
situated about fifty feet from the water, and exceedingly
difficult of access, is said to be crowded with human remains
to the depth of many feet in the earth of the floor. The
roof of the cavern is vaulted. It is about twenty-five feet
in height, thirty in length, and in form is very irregular.
There are several other cavernous fissures among these cliffs
not unworthy description.</p>

<p>The morning's dawn found our steamer gliding quietly
along upon the bright waters of the Illinois. The surface
of the stream was tranquil; not a ripple disturbed its slumbers;
it was currentless; the mighty mass of the Mississippi
was swollen, and, acting as a dam across the mouth of its
tributary, caused a <i>back-water</i> of an hundred miles. The
waters of the Illinois were consequently stagnant, tepid, and
by no means agreeable to the taste. There was present,
also, a peculiarly bitter twang, [97] thought to be imparted
by the roots of the trees and plants along its banks, which,
when motionless, its waters steep; under these circumstances,
water is always provided from the Mississippi before entering
the mouth of the Illinois. But, whatever its qualities,
this stream, to the eye, is one of the most beautiful that
meanders the earth. As we glided onward upon its calm
bosom, a graceful little fawn, standing upon the margin in
the morning sunlight, was bending her large, lustrous eyes
upon the delicate reflection of her form, mirrored in the
stream; and, like the fabled Narcissus, so enamoured did
she appear with the charm of her own loveliness, that our
noisy approach seemed scarce to startle her; or perchance
she was the pet of some neighbouring log-cabin. The
Illinois is by many considered the "<i>belle rivi&egrave;re</i>" of the
Western waters, and, in a commercial and agricultural view,
is destined, doubtless, to occupy an important rank. Tonti,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the old French chronicler, speaks thus of it:<a name="FNanchor_87_89" id="FNanchor_87_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_89" class="fnanchor">87</a> "The banks
of that river are as charming to the eye as useful to life;
the meadows, fruit-trees, and forests affording everything
that is necessary for men and beasts." It traverses the
entire length of one of the most fertile regions in the Union,
and irrigates, by its tributary streams, half the breadth. Its
channel is sufficiently deep for steamers of the larger class;
its current is uniform, and the obstacles to its navigation
are few, and may be easily removed. The chief of these is
a narrow bar just below the town of Beardstown,<a name="FNanchor_88_90" id="FNanchor_88_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_90" class="fnanchor">88</a> stretching
like a wing-dam quite across to the western bank; and
any boat which may pass this bar [98] can at all times reach
the port of the Rapids. Its length is about three hundred
miles, and its narrowest part, opposite Peru, is about eighty
yards in width. By means of a canal, uniting its waters
with those of Lake Michigan, the internal navigation of the
whole country from New-York to New-Orleans is designed
to be completed.<a name="FNanchor_89_91" id="FNanchor_89_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_91" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>The banks of the Illinois are depressed and monotonous,
liable at all seasons to inundation, and stretch away for
miles to the bluffs in broad prairies, glimpses of whose lively
emerald and silvery lakes, caught at intervals through the
dark fringe of cypress skirting the stream, are very refreshing.
The bottom lands upon either side, from one mile to
five, are seldom elevated much above the ordinary surface
of the stream, and are at every higher stage of water submerged
to the depth of many feet, presenting the appearance
of a stream rolling its tide through an ancient and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
gloomy forest, luxuriant in foliage and vast in extent. It
is not surprising that all these regions should be subject to
the visitations of disease, when we look upon the miserable
cabin of the woodcutter, reared upon the very verge of the
water, surrounded on every side by swamps, and enveloped
in their damp dews and the poisonous exhalations rising
from the seething decomposition of the monstrous vegetation
around. The traveller wonders not at the sallow
complexion, the withered features, and the fleshless, ague-racked
limbs, which, as he passes, peep forth upon him
from the luxuriant foliage of this region of sepulchres; his
only astonishment is, that in such an atmosphere the human
constitution [99] can maintain vitality at all. And yet,
never did the poet's dream image scenery more enchanting
than is sometimes unfolded upon this beautiful stream. I
loved, on a bright sunny morning, to linger hours away upon
the lofty deck, as our steamer thridded the green islets of
the winding waters, and gaze upon the reflection of the
blue sky flecked with cloudlets in the bluer wave beneath,
and watch the startling splash of the glittering fish, as, in
exhilarated joyousness, he flung himself from its tranquil
bosom, and then fell back again into its cool depths.
Along the shore strode the bluebacked wader; the wild buck
bounded to his thicket; the graceful buzzard&mdash;vulture of
the West&mdash;soared majestically over the tree-tops, while the
fitful chant of the fireman at his toil echoed and re-echoed
through the recesses of the forests.</p>

<p>Upon the left, in ascending the Illinois, lie the lands
called the "<i>Military Bounty Tract</i>," reserved by Congress
for distribution among the soldiers of the late war with
Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_90_92" id="FNanchor_90_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_92" class="fnanchor">90</a> It is comprehended within the peninsula<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, about an hundred
and seventy miles in length and sixty broad, embracing
twelve of the northwest counties of the state. This tract
of country is said to be exceedingly fertile, abounding
in beautiful prairies and lakes; but the delta or alluvial
regions cannot but prove unhealthy. Its disposition for
the purpose of military bounties has retarded its settlement
behind that of any other quarter of the state; a very inconsiderable
portion has been appropriated by the soldiers;
most of the titles have [100] long since departed, and the
land has been disposed of past redemption for taxes.
Much is also held by non-residents, who estimate it at an
exorbitant value; but large tracts can be obtained for a trifling
consideration, the purchaser risking the title, and
many flourishing settlements are now springing up, especially
along the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Near the southern extremity of the Military Tract, at a
point where the river sweeps out a deep bend from its
western bank, about fifty years since was situated the
little French village of <i>Cape au Gris</i>, or Grindstone Point,
so named from the neighbouring rocks. The French seem
to have vied with the natives in rendering the "signification"
conformable to the "thing signified," in bestowing
names upon their explorations in the West. The village
of <i>Cape au Gris</i> was situated upon the bank of the river,
and, so late as 1811, consisted of twenty or thirty families,
who cultivated a "common field" of five hundred acres
on the adjacent prairie, stretching across the peninsula
towards the Mississippi. At the commencement of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
late war they were driven away by the savages, and a
small garrison from the cantonment of Belle Fontaine,
at the confluence, was subsequently stationed near the
spot by General Wilkinson. A few years after the close
of the war American emigration commenced. This is supposed
to have been the site, also, of one of the forts erected
by La Salle on his second visit to the West.<a name="FNanchor_91_93" id="FNanchor_91_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_93" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>As we ascended the Illinois, flourishing villages were constantly
meeting the eye upon either bank of the stream.
Among these were the euphonious [101] names of Monroe,
Montezuma, Naples, and Havana! At Beardstown the
rolling prairie is looked upon for the first time; it afterward
frequently recurs. As our steamer drew nigh to the
renowned little city of Pekin, we beheld the bluffs lined
with people of all sexes and sizes, watching our approach
as we rounded up to the landing.<a name="FNanchor_92_94" id="FNanchor_92_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_94" class="fnanchor">92</a> Some of our passengers,
surprised at such a gathering together in such a decent,
well-behaved little settlement as Pekin, sagely surmised the
loss of a day from the calendar, and began to believe it the
first instead of the last of the week, until reflection and
observation induced the belief that other rites than those
of religion had called the multitude together. Landing,
streets, tavern, and groceries&mdash;which latter, be it spoken of
the renowned Pekin, were like anything but "angel's visits"
in recurrence&mdash;all were swarmed by a motley assemblage,
seemingly intent upon <i>doing nothing</i>, and that, too, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
noisiest way. Here a congregation of keen-visaged worthies
were gathered around a loquacious land-speculator, beneath
the shadow of a sign-post, listening to an eloquent holding-forth
upon the merits, relative and distinctive, of prairie
land and bluff; there a cute-looking personage, with a twinkle
of the eye and sanctimoniousness of phiz, was vending his
wares by the token of a flaunting strip of red baize; while
lusty viragoes, with infants at the breast, were battering
their passage through the throng, crowing over a "bargain"
on which the "cute" pedler had cleared not <i>more</i> than cent.
per cent. And then there were sober men and men not
sober; individuals half seas over and whole seas [102] over,
all in as merry trim as well might be; while, as a sort of
presiding genius over the bacchanal, a worthy wag, tipsy
as a satyr, in a long calico gown, was prancing through
the multitude, with infinite importance, on the skeleton of
an unhappy horse, which, between <i>nicking</i> and <i>docking</i>,
a spavined limb and a spectral eye, looked the veritable
genius of misery. The cause of all this commotion
appeared to be neither more nor less than a redoubted
"monkey show," which had wound its way over the
mountains into the regions of the distant West, and
reared its dingy canvass upon the smooth sward of the
prairie. It was a spectacle by no means to be slighted,
and "divers came from afar" to behold its wonders.</p>

<p>For nothing, perhaps, have foreign tourists in our country
ridiculed us more justly than for that pomposity of nomenclature
which we have delighted to apply to the thousand
and one towns and villages sprinkled over our maps and
our land; instance whereof this same renowned representative
of the Celestial Empire concerning which I have been
writing. Its brevity is its sole commendation; for as to the
taste or appropriateness of such a name for such a place,
to say naught of the euphony, there's none. And then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
besides Pekin, there are Romes, and Troys, and Palmyras,
and Belgrades, Londons and Liverpools, Babels and
Babylons <i>without account</i>, all rampant in the glories of
log huts, with sturdy porkers forth issuing from their
sties, by way, doubtless, of the sturdy knight-errants of
yore caracoling from the sally-ports of their illustrious
[103] namesakes. But why, in the name of all propriety,
this everlasting plagiarizing of the Greek, Gothic,
Gallic patronymics of the Old World, so utterly incongruous
as applied to the backwoods settlements of the
New! If in very poverty of invention, or in the meagerness
of our "land's language," we, as a people, feel
ourselves unequal to the task&mdash;one, indeed, of no ordinary
magnitude&mdash;of christening all the newborn villages
of our land with melodious and appropriate appellations,
may it not be advisable either to nominate certain worthy
dictionary-makers for the undertaking, or else to retain the
ancient Indian names? Why discard the smooth-flowing,
expressive appellations bestowed by the injured aborigines
upon the gliding streams and flowery plains of this land
of their fathers, only to supersede them by affixes most
foreign and absurd? "Is this proceeding just and honourable"
towards that unfortunate race? Have we visited them
with so <i>many</i> returns of kindness that this would overflow
the cup of recompense? Why tear away the last and only
relic of the past yet lingering in our midst? Have we
too many memorials of the olden time? Why disrobe the
venerable antique of that classic drapery which alone can
befit the severe nobility of its mien, only to deck it out in the
starched and tawdry preciseness of a degenerate taste?</p>

<p>"Good-evening, sir; a good-evening to ye, sir; pleased
with our village, sir!" This was the frank and free salutation
a genteel, farmer-looking personage, with a broad
face, a broad-brimmed hat, and a broad-skirted coat, addressed
to me as I stood before the inn door at Peoria,
looking out upon her beautiful lake. On learning, in
reply to his inquiry, "Whence do ye come, stranger?" that
my birth spot was north of the Potomac, he hailed me
with hearty greeting and warm grasp as a brother. "I am
a Yankee, sir; yes, sir, I am a genuine export of the old
'Bay State.' Many years have gone since I left her
soil; but I remember well the 'Mistress of the North,'
with her green islands and blue waters. In my young
days, sir, I wandered all over the six states, and I have
not forgotten the valley of the Connecticut. I have seen
the 'Emporium' with her Neapolitan bay, and I have
looked on the 'city of the monuments and fountains;'
but in all my journeyings, stranger, I have not found a
spot so pleasant as this little quiet Peoria of the Western
wilderness!" Whether to smile in admiration [105]
or to smile at the oddity of this singular compound
of truth and exaggeration, propounded, withal, in such
grandiloquent style and language, I was at a loss; and
so, just as every prudent man would have acted under
the circumstances, <i>neither</i> was done; and the quiet remark,
"You are an enthusiast, sir," was all that betrayed to the
worthy man the emotions of the sublime and ridiculous of
which he had been the unwitting cause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>But, truly, the little town with this soft Indian name is a
beautiful place, as no one who has ever visited it has failed
to remark. The incidents of its early history are fraught
with the wild and romantic. The old village of Peoria was
one of the earliest settlements of the French in the Mississippi
Valley; and, many years before the memory of the
present generation, it had been abandoned by its founders,
a new village having been erected upon the present site,
deemed less unhealthy than the former. The first house
is said to have been built in new Peoria, or <i>La ville de
Maillet</i>, as was its <i>nom de nique</i>, about the year 1778; and
the situation was directly at the outlet of the lake, one
mile and a half below the old settlement.<a name="FNanchor_93_95" id="FNanchor_93_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_95" class="fnanchor">93</a> Its inhabitants
consisted chiefly of that wild, semi-savage race of Indian
traders, hunters, trappers, voyageurs, <i>couriers du bois</i>, and
half-breeds, which long formed the sole link of union
between the northern lakes and the southwest. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
residing nearly half a century on this pleasant spot, in
that happy harmony with their ferocious neighbours for
which the early French were so remarkable, they were at
length, in the [106] autumn of 1812, exiled from their
ancient home by the militia of Illinois, on charge of
conniving at Indian atrocities upon our people, a party
having been fired on at night while anchored before the
village in their boats. The villagers fled for refuge to their
friends upon the Mississippi. In the autumn of the succeeding
year, General Howard,<a name="FNanchor_94_96" id="FNanchor_94_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_96" class="fnanchor">94</a> with 1400 men, ascended
the Illinois; a fortress was constructed at Peoria in twelve
days from timber cut on the opposite side of the lake.
It was named Fort Clarke, and was occupied by a detachment
of United States' troops. In course of a few weeks
the whole frontier was swept of hostile Indians. On the
termination of hostilities with Great Britain the fort was
abandoned, and soon after was burned by the Indians,
though the ruins are yet to be seen. The present
settlement was commenced by emigrants but a few years
since, and has advanced with a rapidity scarcely paralleled
even in the West. Geographically, it is the centre
of the state, and may at some future day become its seat
of government. It is the shire town of a county of the
same name; has a handsome courthouse of freestone; the
neighbouring regions are fertile, and beds of bituminous
coal are found in the vicinity. These circumstances render
this spot, than which few can boast a more eventful history,
one of the most eligible <i>locales</i> in the state for the emigrant.</p>

<p>Its situation is indescribably beautiful, extending along
the lake of the same name, the Indian name of which was
<i>Pinatahwee</i>, for several miles from its outlet. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
water-sheet, which is little more than an expansion of the
stream of from one to three miles, stretches away for about
twenty, and is divided near its middle by a contraction
called the <i>Narrows</i>. Its waters are exceedingly limpid,
gliding gently over a pebbly bottom, and abounding in fish
of fifty different species, from which an attempt for obtaining
oil on a large scale was commenced a few years since,
but was abandoned without success. Some of the varieties
of these fish are said to be rare and curious. Several specimens
of a species called the "Alligator Garr" have been
taken. The largest was about seven feet in length, a yard
in circumference, and encased in armour of hornlike scales
of quadrilateral form, impenetrable to a rifle-ball. The
weight was several hundred pounds; the form and the teeth&mdash;of
which there were several rows&mdash;similar to those of
the shark, and, upon the whole, the creature seemed not a
whit less formidable. Another singular variety found is the
"spoonfish," about four feet in length, with a black skin,
and an extension of the superior mandible for two feet, of
a thin, flat, shovel-like form, used probably for digging its
food. The more ordinary species, pike, perch, salmon,
trout, buffalo, mullet, and catfish, abound in the lake, while
the surface is covered with geese, ducks, gulls, a species of
water turkey, and, not unfrequently, swans and pelicans.
Its bottom contains curious petrifactions and carnelions of
a rare quality.</p>

<p>From the pebbly shore of the lake, gushing out with
fountains of sparkling water along its whole extent, rises a
rolling bank, upon which now stands most of the village.
A short distance and you ascend a second eminence, and
beyond this you reach [108] the bluffs, some of them an
hundred feet in height, gracefully rounded, and corresponding
with the meandering of the stream below. From the
summit of these bluffs the prospect is uncommonly fine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
At their base is spread out a beautiful prairie, its tall grass-tops
and bright-died flowerets nodding to the soft summer
wind. Along its eastern border is extended a range of
neat edifices, while lower down sleep the calm, clear waters
of the lake, unruffled by a ripple, and reflecting from
its placid bosom the stupendous vegetation of the wooded
alluvion beyond.</p>

<p>It was near the close of a day of withering sultriness
that we reached Peoria. Passing the Kickapoo, or Red
Bud Creek,<a name="FNanchor_95_97" id="FNanchor_95_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_97" class="fnanchor">95</a> a sweep in the stream opened before the eye a
panorama of that magnificent water-sheet of which I have
spoken, so calm and motionless that its mirror surface
seemed suspended in the golden mistiness of the summer
atmosphere which floated over it. As we were approaching
the village a few sweet notes of a bugle struck the ear;
and in a few moments a lengthened troop of cavalry, with
baggage-cars and military paraphernalia, was beheld
winding over a distant roll of the prairie, their arms
glittering gayly in the horizontal beams of the sinking sun
as the ranks appeared, were lost, reappeared, and then, by
an inequality in the route, were concealed from the view.
The steamer "Helen Mar" was lying at the landing as
we rounded up, most terribly shattered by the collapsing
of the flue of one of her boilers a few days before in the
vicinity. She had been swept by the death-blast from one
extremity [109] to the other, and everything was remaining
just as when the accident occurred, even to the pallets
upon which had been stretched the mangled bodies, and
the remedies applied for their relief. The disasters of
steam have become, till of late, of such ordinary occurrence
upon the waters of the West, that they have been thought
of comparatively but little; yet in no aspect does the angel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
death perform his bidding more fearfully. Misery's own
pencil can delineate no scene of horror more revolting;
humanity knows no visitation more terrible! The atmosphere
of hell envelops the victim and sweeps him from the
earth!</p>

<p>Happening casually to fall in with several gentlemen at
the inn who chanced to have some acquaintance with the
detachment of dragoons I have mentioned, I accepted with
pleasure an invitation to accompany them on a visit to the
encampment a few miles from the town. The moon was
up, and was flinging her silvery veil over the landscape when
we reached the bivouac. It was a picturesque spot, a low
prairie-bottom on the margin of the lake, beneath a range
of wooded bluffs in the rear; and the little white tents
sprinkled about upon the green shrubbery beneath the trees;
the stacks of arms and military accoutrements piled up
beneath or suspended from their branches; the dragoons
around their tents, engaged in the culinary operations of
the camp, or listlessly lolling upon the grass as the laugh
and jest went free; the horses grazing among the thickets,
while over the whole was resting the misty splendour of
the moonlight, [110] made up a <i>tout ensemble</i> not unworthy
the crayon of a Weir.<a name="FNanchor_96_98" id="FNanchor_96_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_98" class="fnanchor">96</a> The detachment was a small one,
consisting of only one hundred men, under command of
Captain S&mdash;&mdash;, on an excursion from Camp des Moines,
at the lower rapids of the Mississippi, to Fort Howard, on
Green Bay, partially occasioned by a rumour of Indian hos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>tilities
threatened in that vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_97_99" id="FNanchor_97_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_99" class="fnanchor">97</a> They were a portion
of several companies of the first regiment of dragoons,
levied by Congress a few years since for the protection
of the Western frontier, in place of the "Rangers," so styled,
in whom that trust had previously reposed. They were all
Americans, resolute-looking fellows enough, and originally
rendezvoused at Jefferson Barracks. The design of such
a corps is doubtless an excellent one; but military men tell
us that some unpardonable omissions were made in the provisions
of the bill reported by Congress in which the corps
had its origin; for, according to the present regulations,
all approximation to discipline is precluded. Captain
S&mdash;&mdash; received us leisurely reclining upon a buffalo-robe
in his tent; and, in a brief interview, we found him pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>sessed
of all that gentlemanly <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> which foreign travellers
would have us believe is, in our country, confined
to the profession of arms. The night-dews of the lowlands
had for some hours been falling when we reached the village
drenched with their damps.</p>

<p>Much to our regret, the stage of water in the Illinois
would not permit our boat to ascend the stream, as had been
the intention, to Hennepin, some twenty miles above, and
Ottawa, at the foot of the rapids.<a name="FNanchor_98_100" id="FNanchor_98_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_100" class="fnanchor">98</a> Nearly equidistant between
these [111] flourishing towns, upon the eastern bank of
the Illinois, is situated that remarkable crag, termed by the
early French "<i>Le Rocher</i>," by the Indian traditions "<i>Starved
Rock</i>," and by the present dwellers in its vicinity, as well as
by Schoolcraft and the maps, "<i>Rockfort</i>." It is a tall cliff,
composed of alternate strata of lime and sandstone, about
two hundred and fifty feet in height by report, and one
hundred and thirty-four by actual measurement. Its base
is swept by the current, and it is perfectly precipitous upon
three sides. The fourth side, by which alone it is accessible,
is connected with the neighbouring range of bluffs by
a natural causeway, which can be ascended only by a difficult
and tortuous path. The summit of the crag is clothed
with soil to the depth of several feet, sufficient to sustain a
growth of stunted cedars. It is about one hundred feet in
diameter, and comprises nearly an acre of level land. The
name of "Starved Rock" was obtained by this inaccessible
battlement from a legend of Indian tradition, an outline
of which may be found in Flint's work upon the Western
Valley, and an interesting story wrought from its incidents
in Hall's "Border Tales." A band of the Illini having assassinated
Pontiac, the Ottoway chieftain, in 1767, the tribe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of the Pottawattamies made war upon them. The Illini,
being defeated, fled for refuge to this rock, which a little
labour soon rendered inaccessible to all the assaults of their
enemy. At this crisis, after repeated repulse, the besiegers
determined to reduce the hold by <i>starvation</i>, as the only
method remaining. The tradition of this siege affords, perhaps,
[112] as striking an illustration of Indian character as
is furnished by our annals of the unfortunate race. Food
in some considerable quantity had been provided by the
besieged; but when, parched by thirst, they attempted during
the night to procure water from the cool stream rushing below
them by means of ropes of bark, the enemy detected
the design, and their vessels were cut off by a guard in
canoes. The last resource was defeated; every stratagem
discovered; hope was extinguished; the unutterable tortures
of thirst were upon them; a terrific death in anticipation;
yet they yielded not; the speedier torments of the stake and
a triumph to their foes was the alternative. And so they
perished&mdash;all, with a solitary exception&mdash;a woman, who
was adopted by the hostile tribe, and was living not half
a century since. For years the summit of this old cliff was
whitened by the bones of the victims; and quantities of
remains, as well as arrow-heads and domestic utensils, are
at the present day exhumed. Shells are also found, but
their <i>whence</i> and <i>wherefore</i> are not easily determined. At
the only accessible point there is said to be an appearance
of an intrenchment and rampart. A glorious view of the
Illinois, which, forming a curve, laves more than half of the
column's base, is obtained from the summit. An ancient
post of the French is believed to have once stood here.<a name="FNanchor_99_101" id="FNanchor_99_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_101" class="fnanchor">99</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Brightly were the moonbeams streaming over the blue
lake Pinatahwee as our steamer glided from its waters. Near
midnight, as we swept past Pekin, we were roused from our
slumbers by the plaintive [113] notes of the "German Hymn,"
which mellowly came stealing from distance over the waters;
and we almost pardoned the "Menagerie" its multifold
transgressions because of that touching air. There is a
chord in almost every bosom, however rough and unharmonious
its ordinary emotions, which fails not to vibrate
beneath the gentle influences of "sweet sounds." From
this, as from the strings of the wind-harp, a zephyr
may elicit a melody of feeling which the storm could
never have awakened. There are seasons, too, when the
nerves and fibres of the system, reposing in quietness,
are most exquisitely attempered to the mysterious influences
and the delicate breathings of harmony; and such a season
is that calm, holy hour, when deep sleep hath descended
upon man, and his unquiet pulsings have for an interval
ceased their fevered beat. To be awakened then by music's
cadence has upon us an effect unearthly! It calls forth
from their depths the richest emotions of the heart. The
moonlight serenade! Ah, its wild witchery has told upon
the romance of many a young bosom! If you have a mistress,
and you would woo her <i>not vainly</i>, woo her thus!
I remember me, when once a resident of the courtly city of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
L&mdash;&mdash;, to have been awakened one morning long before the
dawn by a strain of distant music, which, swelling and rising
upon the still night-air, came floating like a spirit through
the open windows and long galleries of the building. I
arose; all was calm, and silent, and deserted through the
dim, lengthened streets of the city. Not a light gleamed
from a casement; not a [114] footfall echoed from the pavement;
not a breath broke the stillness save the crowing of
the far-off cock proclaiming the morn, and the low rumble
of the marketman's wagon; and then, swelling upon the
night-wind, fitfully came up that beautiful gush of melody,
wave upon wave, surge after surge, billow upon billow, winding
itself into the innermost cells of the soul!</p>

<p>More than three weeks ago I found myself, one bright
morning at sunrise, before the city of St. Louis on descending
the Illinois; and in that venerable little city have I ever
since been a dweller. A series of those vexatious delays,
ever occurring to balk the designs of the tourist, have detained
me longer than could have been anticipated. Not
the [115] most inconsiderable of these preventives to locomotion
in this bustling, swapping, chaffering little city,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
strange as it may seem, has been the difficulty of procuring,
at a conscionable outlay of dollars and cents, a suitable
steed for a protracted jaunt. But, thanks to the civility
or <i>selfism</i> of a friend, this difficulty is at an end, and I have
at length succeeded in securing the reversion of a tough,
spirited little bay, which, by considerate usage and bountiful
foddering, may serve to bear me, with the requisite
quantum of speed and safety, over the prairies. A few
days, therefore, when the last touch of <i>acclimation</i> shall
have taken its leave, and "I'm over the border and awa'."</p>

<p>The city of San' Louis, now hoary with a century's years,
was one of those early settlements planted by the Canadian
French up and down the great valley, from the Northern
Lakes to the Gulf, while the English colonists of Plymouth
and Jamestown were wringing out a wretched subsistence
along the sterile shores of the Atlantic, wearied out by
constant warfare with the thirty Indian tribes within their
borders. Attracted by the beauty of the country, the fertility
of its soil, the boundless variety of its products,
the exhaustless mineral treasures beneath its surface, and
the facility of the trade in the furs of the Northwest, a
flood of Canadian emigration opened southward after the
discoveries of La Salle, and the little villages of Cahokia,
Kaskaskia, Prairie du Po, Prairie du Rocher, St. Phillipe,
St. Ferdinand, Peoria, Fort Chartres, Vuide Poche, Petites
Cotes, now St. Charles, Pain Court, now St. Louis, and
others, successively sprang up in [116] the howling waste.
Over nearly all this territory have the Gaul, the Spaniard,
the Briton, and the Anglo-American held rule, and a
dash of the national idiosyncrasy of each may be detected.
Especially true is this of St. Louis. There is an antiquated,
venerable air about its narrow streets and the
ungainly edifices of one portion of it; the steep-roofed
stone cottage of the Frenchman, and the tall stuccoed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>-dwelling
of the Don, not often beheld. A mellowing
touch of time, which few American cities can boast, has
passed over it, rendering it a spot of peculiar interest to
one with the slightest spirit of the antiquary, in a country
where all else is new. The modern section of the city, with
its regular streets and lofty edifices, which, within the past
fifteen years, has arisen under the active hand of the northern
emigrant, presents a striking contrast to the old.</p>

<p>The site of St. Louis is elevated and salubrious, lying
for some miles along the Mississippi upon two broad plateaux
or steppes swelling up gently from the water's edge.
Along the first of these, based upon an exhaustless bed of
limestone, which furnishes material for building, are situated
the lower and central portions of the city, while that
above sweeps away in an extensive prairie of stunted black-jack
oaks to the west. The latter section is already laid out
into streets and building-lots; elegant structures are rapidly
going up, and, at no distant day, this is destined to become
the most courtly and beautiful portion of the city. It is at
a pleasant remove from the dust and bustle of the landing,
[117] while its elevation affords a fine view of the harbour
and opposite shore. Yet, with all its improvements of the
past few years, St. Louis remains emphatically "a little
<i>French</i> city." There is about it a cheerful village air, a
certain <i>rus in rube</i>, to which the grenadier preciseness of
most of our cities is the antipodes. There are but few of
those endless, rectilinear avenues, cutting each other into
broad squares of lofty granite blocks, so characteristic of
the older cities of the North and East, or of those cities of
tramontane origin so rapidly rising within the boundaries
of the valley. There yet remains much in St. Louis
to remind one of its village days; and a stern <i>eschewal</i>
of mathematical, angular exactitude is everywhere beheld.
Until within a few years there was no such thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
as a row of houses; all were disjoined and at a considerable
distance from each other; and every edifice, however central,
could boast its humble <i>stoop</i>, its front-door plat, bedecked
with shrubbery and flowers, and protected from the inroads
of intruding man or beast by its own tall stoccade. All
this is now confined to the southern or French section of
the city; a right Rip Van Winkle-looking region, where each
little steep-roofed cottage yet presents its broad piazza, and
the cosey settee before the door beneath the tree shade, with
the fleshy old burghers soberly luxuriating on an evening
pipe, their dark-eyed, brunette daughters at their side.
There is a delightful air of "old-fashioned comfortableness"
in all this, that reminds us of nothing we have seen in our
own country, but much of the antiquated villages of which
we have [118] been told in the land beyond the waters.
Among those remnants of a former generation which are
yet to be seen in St. Louis are the venerable mansions of
Auguste and Pierre Chouteau, who were among the founders
of the city.<a name="FNanchor_100_102" id="FNanchor_100_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_102" class="fnanchor">100</a> These extensive mansions stand upon
the principal street, and originally occupied, with their
grounds, each of them an entire square, enclosed by lofty
walls of heavy masonry, with loopholes and watch-towers
for defence. The march of improvement has encroached
upon the premises of these ancient edifices somewhat; yet
they are still inhabited by the posterity of their builders,
and remain, with their massive walls of stone, monuments
of an earlier era.</p>

<p>The site upon which stands St. Louis was selected in
1763 by M. Laclede, a partner of a mercantile association
at New-Orleans, to whom D'Abbadie, Director-general of
the province of Louisiana, had granted the exclusive privilege
of the commerce in furs and peltries with the Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
tribes of the Upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. By
the treaty of that year France had ceded all her possessions
east of the Mississippi to Great Britain, and there was on
the western shore only the small village of Ste. Genevieve.
This was subsequently deemed too distant from the mouth
of the Mississippi to be a suitable dep&ocirc;t and post for the
fur-trade; and Laclede, having surveyed all the neighbouring
region, fixed upon the spot where St. Louis now stands
as a more eligible site. Whether this site was selected by
the flight of birds, by consultation of the entrails of beasts,
or the voice of an oracle; whether by accident [119] or design,
tradition averreth not. Yet sure is it, that under the
concurrence of all these omens, a more favourable selection
could not have been made than this has proved. It <i>is related</i>,
however, that when the founder of the city first planted
foot upon the shore, the imprint of a human foot, naked
and of gigantic dimensions, was found enstamped upon the
solid limestone rock, and continued in regular succession
as if of a man advancing from the water's edge to the plateau
above.<a name="FNanchor_101_103" id="FNanchor_101_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_103" class="fnanchor">101</a> By a more superstitious age this circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>stance
would have been deemed an omen, and, as such,
commemorated in the chronicles of the city. On the 15th
of February, 1764, Colonel Auguste Chouteau, with a number
of persons from Ste. Genevieve, Cahokia, and Fort
Chartres, arrived at the spot, and commenced a settlement
by felling a splendid grove of forest-trees which then reared
itself upon the bank, and erecting a building where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
market-house now stands. The town was then laid off,
and named in honour of Louis XV., the reigning monarch
of France, though the settlers were desirous of giving it the
name of its founder: to this Laclede would not consent.
He died at the post of Arkansas in 1778; Colonel Chouteau
followed him in the month of February of 1829, just sixty-four
years from the founding of the city. He had been a
constant resident, had seen the spot merge from the wilderness,
and had become one of its most opulent citizens.</p>

<p>For many years St. Louis was called "<i>Pain</i> [120] <i>Court</i>,"
from the scarcity of provisions, which circumstance at one
period almost induced the settlers to abandon their design.
In 1765 Fort Chartres was delivered to Great Britain, and
the commandant, St. Ange, with his troops, only twenty-two
in number, proceeded to St. Louis; and assuming the
government, the place was ever after considered the capital
of the province.<a name="FNanchor_102_104" id="FNanchor_102_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_104" class="fnanchor">102</a> Under the administration of St. Ange,
which is said to have been mild and patriarchal, the <i>common
field</i> was laid open, and each settler became a cultivator of
the soil. This field comprised several thousand acres, lying
upon the second steppe mentioned, and has recently been
divided into lots and sold to the highest bidder. Three
years after the arrival of St. Ange, Spanish troops under
command of Don Rious took possession of the province
agreeable to treaty;<a name="FNanchor_103_105" id="FNanchor_103_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_105" class="fnanchor">103</a> but, owing to the dissatisfaction of
the inhabitants, no official authority was exercised until 1770.
Thirty years afterward the province was retroceded to France,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and from that nation to the United States. In the spring
of 1778 an attack was made upon the village by a large body
of the northern Indians, at the instigation of the English.
They were repulsed with a loss of about twenty of the settlers,
and the year was commemorated as "<i>L'annee du grand
coup</i>."<a name="FNanchor_104_106" id="FNanchor_104_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_106" class="fnanchor">104</a> In the spring of 1785, the Mississippi rose thirty
feet above the highest water-mark previously known, and
the American Bottom was inundated. This year was remembered
as "<i>L'annee des grandes eaux</i>."</p>

<p>At that period commerce with New-Orleans, for [121]
the purpose of obtaining merchandise for the fur trade, was
carried on exclusively by keel-boats and barges, which in
the spring started upon their voyage of more than a thousand
miles, and in the fall of the year slowly returned against
the current. This mode of transportation was expensive,
tedious, and unsafe; and it was rendered yet more hazardous
from the murders and robberies of a large band
of free-booters, under two chiefs, Culburt and Magilbray,
who stationed themselves at a place called Cotton Wood
Creek, on the Mississippi, and captured the ascending
boats. This band was dispersed by a little fleet of ten
barges, which, armed with swivels, ascended the river in
company. This year was remembered as "<i>L'annee des
bateaux</i>."<a name="FNanchor_105_107" id="FNanchor_105_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_107" class="fnanchor">105</a> All the inconvenience of this method of trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>portation
continued to be experienced until the introduction
of steam upon the Western waters; and the first boat
of this kind which made its appearance at the port of St.
Louis was the "General Pike," in 1814. This boat was
commanded by Captain Jacob Reed, and, at the time of
its arrival, a large body of a neighbouring Indian tribe
chanced to have an encampment in the suburbs of the city.
Their astonishment, and even <i>terror</i>, at first sight of the evolutions
of the steamer, are said to have been indescribable.
They viewed it as nothing less than a living thing; a monster
of tremendous power, commissioned by the "Great
Spirit" for their extermination, and their humiliation was
proportional to their terror. Great opposition was raised
against steamers by the boatmen, some thousands of whom,
by their introduction, would [122] be thrown out of employment;
but this feeling gradually passed away, and now vessels
propelled by steam perform in a few days a voyage
which formerly required as many months. A trip to the city,
as New-Orleans, <i>par excellence</i>, was styled, then demanded
weeks of prior preparation, and a man put his house and
household in order before setting out: now it is an ordinary
jaunt of pleasure. The same dislike manifested by the
old French <i>habitans</i> to the introduction of the steamer or
<i>smoke-boat</i>, "bateau &agrave; vapeur," as they termed it, has betrayed
itself at every advance of modern improvement.
Erected, as St. Louis was, with no design of a city, its houses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
were originally huddled together with a view to nothing but
convenience; and its streets were laid out too narrow and
too irregular for the bustle and throng of mercantile operations.
In endeavouring to correct this early error, by removing
a few of the old houses and projecting balconies,
great opposition has been encountered. Some degree of
uniformity in the three principal streets parallel to the river
has, however, by this method been attained. Water-street
is well built up with a series of lofty limestone warehouses;
but an irretrievable error has been committed in arranging
them at so short a distance from the water. On some accounts
this proximity to the river may be convenient; but
for the sake of a broad arena for commerce; for the sake of
a fresh and salubrious circulation of air from the water;
for the sake of scenic beauty, or a noble promenade for
pleasure, there should have been no encroachment upon
the precincts [123] of the "eternal river." In view of the
miserable <i>plan</i> of St. Louis, if it may claim anything of
the kind, and the irregular manner and singular taste with
which it has been built, the regret has more than once been
expressed, that, like Detroit,<a name="FNanchor_106_108" id="FNanchor_106_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_108" class="fnanchor">106</a> a conflagration had not
swept it in its earlier days, and given place to an arrangement
at once more consistent with elegance and convenience.</p>

<p>From the river bank to the elevated ground sweeping off
in the rear of the city to the west is a distance of several
hundred yards, and the height above the level of the
water cannot be far from an hundred feet. The ascent is
easy, however, and a noble view is obtained, from the cupola
of the courthouse on its summit, of the Mississippi and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
city below, of the broad American Bottom, with its bluffs
in the distance, and a beautiful extent of natural scenery in
the rear. Along the brow of this eminence once stood a
line of military works, erected for the defence of the old
town in 1780 by Don Francois de Cruzat, lieutenant governor
"<i>de la partie occidentale des Illinois</i>," as the ancient
chronicles style the region west of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_107_109" id="FNanchor_107_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_109" class="fnanchor">107</a> These
fortifications consisted of several circular towers of stone,
forty feet in diameter and half as many in altitude, planted
at intervals in a line of stoccade, besides a small fort, embracing
four demilunes and a parapet of mason-work. For
many years these old works were in a dismantled and deserted
state, excepting the fort, in one building of which
was held [124] the court, and another superseded the
necessity of a prison. Almost every vestige is now swept
away. The great earthquakes of 1811 essentially assisted
in toppling the old ruins to the ground. The whole city
was powerfully shaken, and has since been subject to
occasional shocks.<a name="FNanchor_108_110" id="FNanchor_108_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_110" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>It is in the northern suburbs of the city that are to be
seen those singular ancient mounds for which St. Louis is
so celebrated; and which, with others in the vicinity, form,
as it were, a connecting link between those of the north,
commencing in the lake counties of Western New-York, and
those of the south, extending deep within the boundaries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of Mexico, forming an unbroken line from one extremity
of the great valley to the other. Their position at St. Louis
is, as usual, a commanding one, upon the second bank, of
which I have spoken, and looking proudly down upon the
Mississippi, along which the line is parallel. They stand
isolated, or distinct from each other, in groups; and the
outline is generally that of a rectangular pyramid, truncated
nearly one half. The first collection originally consisted
of ten tumuli, arranged as three sides of a square area of
about four acres, and the open flank to the west was guarded
by five other small circular earth-heaps, isolated, and forming
the segment of a circle around [125] the opening. This
group is now almost completely destroyed by the grading
of streets and the erection of edifices, and the eastern border
may alone be traced. North of the first collection of
tumuli is a second, four or five in number, and forming two
sides of a square. Among these is one of a very beautiful
form, consisting of three stages, and called the "Falling
Garden." Its elevation above the level of the second plateau
is about four feet, and the area is ample for a dwelling
and yard; from the second it descends to the first plateau
along the river by three regular gradations, the first with
a descent of two feet, the second of ten, and the lower one of
five, each stage presenting a beautiful site for a house. For
this purpose, however, they can never be appropriated, as
one of the principal streets of the city is destined to pass
directly through the spot, the grading for which is already
commenced. The third group of mounds is situated a few
hundred yards above the second, and consists of about a
dozen eminences. A series extends along the west side of
the street, through grounds attached to a classic edifice of
brick, which occupies the principal one; while opposite rise
several of a larger size, upon one of which is situated the
residence of General Ashley, and upon another the reservoir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
which supplies the city with water, raised from the Mississippi
by a steam force-pump upon its banks. Both are beautiful
spots, imbowered in forest-trees; and the former, from
its size and structure, is supposed to have been a citadel
or place of defence. [126] In excavating the earth of this
mound, large quantities of human remains, pottery, half-burned
wood, &amp;c., &amp;c., were thrown up; furnishing conclusive
evidence, were any requisite farther than regularity of
outline and relative position, of the artificial origin of these
earth-heaps. About six hundred yards above this group,
and linked with it by several inconsiderable mounds, is
situated one completely isolated, and larger than any yet
described. It is upward of thirty feet in height, about one
hundred and fifty feet long, and upon the summit five feet
wide. The form is oblong, resembling an immense grave;
and a broad terrace or apron, after a descent of a few feet,
spreads out itself on the side looking down upon the river.
From the extensive view of the surrounding region and of
the Mississippi commanded by the site of this mound, as
well as its altitude, it is supposed to have been intended
as a vidette or watch-tower by its builders. Upon its summit,
not many years ago, was buried an Indian chief. He
was a member of a deputation from a distant tribe to the
agency in St. Louis; but, dying while there, his remains,
agreeable to the custom of his tribe, were deposited on the
most commanding spot that could be found. This custom
accounts for the circumstance urged against the antiquity
and artificial origin of these works, that the relics exhumed
are found near the surface, and were deposited by the present
race. But the distinction between the remains found near
the surface and those in the depths of the soil is too palpable
and too [127] notorious to require argument. From
the <i>Big Mound</i>, as it is called, a <i>cordon</i> of tumuli stretch
away to the northwest for several miles along the bluffs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
parallel with the river, a noble view of which they command.
They are most of them ten or twelve feet high; many clothed
with forest-trees, and all of them supposed to be tombs.
In removing two of them upon the grounds of Col. O'Fallon,<a name="FNanchor_109_111" id="FNanchor_109_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_111" class="fnanchor">109</a>
immense quantities of bones were exhumed. Similar
mounds are to be found in almost every county in the
state, and those in the vicinity of St. Louis are remarkable
only for their magnitude and the regularity of their relative
positions. It is evident, from these monuments of a
former generation, that the natural advantages of the site
upon which St. Louis now stands were not unappreciated
long before it was pressed by the first European footstep.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance which has often elicited remark from
those who, as tourists, have visited St. Louis, that so little
interest should be manifested by its citizens for those mysterious
and venerable monuments of another race by which
on every side it is environed. When we consider the complete
absence of everything in the character of a public
square or promenade in the city, one would suppose that
individual taste and municipal authority would not have
failed to avail themselves of the moral interest attached to
these mounds and the beauty of their site, to have formed in
their vicinity one of the most attractive spots in the West.
These ancient tumuli could, at no considerable expense,
have been [128] enclosed and ornamented with shrubbery,
and walks, and flowers, and thus preserved for coming generations.
As it is, they are passing rapidly away; man and
beast, as well as the elements, are busy with them, and in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
few years they will quite have disappeared. The practical
utility of which they are available appears the only circumstance
which has attracted attention to them. One has
already become a public reservoir, and measures are in
progress for applying the larger mound to a similar use,
the first being insufficient for the growth of the city. It
need not be said that such indifference of feeling to the
only relics of a by-gone race which our land can boast,
is not well in the citizens of St. Louis, and should exist no
longer; nor need allusion be made to that eagerness of
interest which the distant traveller, the man of literary
taste and poetic fancy, or the devotee of abstruse science,
never fails to betray for these mysterious monuments of the
past, when, in his tour of the Far West, he visits St. Louis;
many a one, too, who has looked upon the century-mossed
ruins of Europe, and to whose eye the castled crags of the
Rhine are not unfamiliar. And surely, to the imaginative
mind, there is an interest which attaches to these venerable
beacons of departed time, enveloped as they are in mystery
inscrutable; and from their origin, pointing, as they do,
down the dim shadowy vista of ages of which the ken of man
telleth not, there is an interest which hallows them even as
the hoary piles of old Egypt are hallowed, and which feudal
Europe, with all her [129] time-sustained battlements, can
never boast. It is the mystery, the impenetrable mystery
veiling these aged sepulchres, which gives them an interest
for the traveller's eye. They are landmarks in the lapse
of ages, beneath whose shadows generations have mouldered,
and around whose summits a gone <i>eternity</i> plays! The
ruined tower, the moss-grown abbey, the damp-stained dungeon,
the sunken arch, the fairy and delicate fragments of
the shattered peristyle of a classic land, or the beautiful
frescoes of Herculaneum and Pompeii&mdash;around <i>them</i> time
has indeed flung the silvery mantle of eld while he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
swept them with decay; but <i>their</i> years may be <i>enumerated</i>,
and the circumstances, the authors, and the purposes of
their origin, together with the incidents of their ruin, are
chronicled on History's page for coming generations. But
who shall tell the era of the origin of these venerable earth-heaps,
the race of their builders, the purpose of their erection,
the thousand circumstances attending their rise, history,
desertion? Why now so lone and desolate? Where are
the multitudes that once swarmed the prairie at their
base, and vainly busied themselves in rearing piles which
should exist the wonder of the men of other lands, and
the sole monument of their own memory long after they
themselves were dust? Has war, or famine, or pestilence
brooded over these beautiful plains? or has the fiat of
Omnipotence gone forth that as a race their inhabitants
should exist no longer, and the death-angel been commissioned
to sweep them from off the face of [130] the
earth as if with destruction's besom? We ask: the inquiry
is vain; we are answered not! Their mighty creations
and the tombs of myriads heave up themselves in solemn
grandeur before us; but from the depths of the dusky
earth-heap comes forth no voice to tell us its origin, or
object, or story!</p>

<p>Ages since&mdash;long ere the first son of the Old World had
pressed the fresh soil of the New; long before the bright
region beyond the blue wave had been the object of the
philosopher's revery by day and the enthusiast's vision by
night&mdash;in the deep stillness and solitude of an unpeopled
land, these vast mausoleums rose as now they rise, in lonely
grandeur from the plain, and looked down, even as now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
they look, upon the giant flood rolling its dark waters at
their base, hurrying past them to the deep. So has it
been with the massive tombs of Egypt, amid the sands
and barrenness of the desert. For ages untold have the
gloomy pyramids been reflected by the inundations of the
Nile; an hundred generations, they tell us, have arisen
from the cradle and reposed beneath their shadows, and,
like autumn leaves, have dropped into the grave; but from
the deep midnight of by-gone centuries comes forth no
daring spirit to claim these kingly sepulchres as his own!
And shall the dusky piles on the plains of distant Egypt
affect so deeply our reverence for the [131] departed, and
these mighty monuments, reposing in dark sublimity upon
our own magnificent prairies veiled in mystery more inscrutable
than they, call forth no solitary throb? Is there
no hallowing interest associated with these aged relics,
these tombs, and temples, and towers of another race, to
elicit emotion? Are they <i>indeed</i> to us no more than the
dull clods we tread upon? Why, then, does the wanderer
from the far land gaze upon them with wonder and veneration?
Why linger fondly around them, and meditate
upon the power which reared them and is departed? Why
does the poet, the man of genius and fancy, or the philosopher
of mind and nature, seat himself at their base, and,
with strange and undefined emotions, pause and ponder
amid the loneliness which slumbers around? And surely,
if the far traveller, as he wanders through this Western
Valley, may linger around these aged piles and meditate
upon a power departed, a race obliterated, an influence
swept from the earth for ever, and dwell with melancholy
emotions upon the destiny of man, is it not meet that those
into whose keeping they seem by Providence consigned
should regard them with interest and emotion? that they
should gather up and preserve every incident relevant to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
their origin, design, or history which may be attained,
and avail themselves of every measure which may give
to them perpetuity, and hand them down, undisturbed in
form or character, to other generations?</p>

<p>The most plausible, and, indeed, the only plausible argument
urged by those who deny the artificial [132] origin of
the ancient mounds, is <i>their immense size</i>. There are, say
they, "many mounds in the West that exactly correspond
in <i>shape</i> with these supposed antiquities, and yet, from
their <i>size</i>, most evidently were not made by man;" and they
add that "it would be well to calculate upon the ordinary
labour of excavating canals, how many hands, with spades,
wheelbarrows, and other necessary implements, it would
take to throw up mounds like the largest of these within
any given time."<a name="FNanchor_110_112" id="FNanchor_110_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_112" class="fnanchor">110</a> We are told that in the territory of
Wisconsin and in northern Illinois exist mounds to which
these are molehills. Of those, Mount Joliet, Mount Charles,
Sinsinewa, and the Blue Mounds vary from one to four
hundred feet in height; while west of the Arkansas exists
a range of earth-heaps ten or twelve miles in extent, and
two hundred feet high: there also, it might be added, are
the Mamelle Mountains, estimated at one thousand feet.<a name="FNanchor_111_113" id="FNanchor_111_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_113" class="fnanchor">111</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The adjacent country is prairie; farms exist on the summits
of the mounds, which from their declivity are almost inaccessible,
and <i>springs gush out from their sides</i>. With but
one exception I profess to know nothing of these mounds
from personal observation; and, consequently, can hazard
no opinion of their character. The fact of the "gushing
springs," it is true, [133] savours not much of artificialness;
and in this respect, at least, do these mounds differ
from those claimed as of artificial origin. The earth-heaps
of which I have been speaking can boast no "springs of
water gushing from their sides;" if they could, the fact
would be far from corroborating the theory maintained.
The analogy between these mounds is admitted to be
strong, though there exist diversities; and were there <i>none</i>,
even Bishop Butler says that we are not to infer a thing
true upon slight presumption, since "there may be
probabilities on both sides of a question." From what has
been advanced relative to the character of the mounds
spoken of, it is believed that the probabilities strongly preponderate
in favour of their artificial origin, even admitting
their <i>perfect</i> analogy to those "from whose sides gush
the springs." But more anon.</p>

<p>There are few more delightful views in the vicinity of
St. Louis of a fine evening than that commanded by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
summit of the "Big Mound," of which I have spoken, in
the northern suburbs of the city. Far away from the north
comes the Mississippi, sweeping on in a broad, smooth sheet,
skirted by woodlands; and the rushing of its waters along
the ragged rocks of the shores below is fancied faintly to
reach the ear. Nearly in the middle of the stream are
stretched out the long, low, sandy shores of "Blood Island,"
a spot notorious in the annals of duelling. Upon the Illinois
shore beyond it is contemplated erecting a pier, for
the purpose of throwing the full volume of the current
upon the western shore, and thus preserving a channel of
deep water along the landing of the city. Within a few
years past an extensive sand-bar has accumulated opposite
the southern section of the city, which threatens, unless
removed, greatly to obstruct, if not to destroy, the harbour.
To remedy this, an appropriation [135] has been made by
Congress, surveys have been taken, measures devised and
their execution commenced.<a name="FNanchor_112_114" id="FNanchor_112_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_114" class="fnanchor">112</a> Upon the river-bank
opposite the island stands the "Floating Dry Dock," an
ingenious contrivance, the invention of a gentleman of
St. Louis, and owned by a company of patentees.<a name="FNanchor_113_115" id="FNanchor_113_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_115" class="fnanchor">113</a> It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
consists of an indefinite number of floats, which may
be increased or diminished at pleasure, each of them
fourteen feet in breadth, and about four times that length,
connected laterally together. After being sunk and suspended
at the necessary depth in the water, the boat to
be repaired is placed upon them, and they rise till her hull
is completely exposed.</p>

<p>As the spectator, standing upon the Mound, turns his
eye to the south, a green grove lies before him and the
smaller earth-heaps, over which are beheld the towers and
roofs of the city rising in the distance; far beyond is
spread out a smooth, rolling carpet of tree-tops, in the
midst of which the gray limestone of the arsenal is dimly
perceived. The extent between the northern suburbs
of St. Louis and its southern extremity along the river
curve is about six miles, and the city can be profitably
extended about the same distance into the interior. The
prospect in this direction is boundless for miles around,
till the tree-tops blend with the western horizon. The
face of the country is neither uniform nor broken, but
undulates almost imperceptibly away, clothed in a dense
forest of black-jack oak, interspersed with thickets of the
wild-plum, the crab-apple, and the hazel. Thirty years
ago, and this broad plain was a treeless, shrubless waste,
[136] without a solitary farmhouse to break the monotony.
But the annual fires were stopped; a young forest sprang
into existence; and delightful villas and country seats
are now gleaming from the dark foliage in all directions.
To some of them are attached extensive grounds, adorned
with groves, orchards, fish-ponds, and all the elegances of
opulence and cultivated taste; while in the distance are
beheld the glittering spires of the city rising above the trees.
At one of these, a retired, beautiful spot, residence of Dr.
F&mdash;&mdash;, I have passed many a pleasant hour. The sports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>man
may here be indulged to his heart's desire. The woods
abound with game of every species: the rabbit, quail, prairie-hen,
wild-turkey, and the deer; while the lakes, which flash
from every dell and dingle, are swarmed with fish. Most
of these sheets of water are formed by immense springs
issuing from <i>sink-holes</i>; and are supposed, like those in
Florida, which suggested the wild idea of the <i>fountain of
rejuvenescence</i>, to owe their origin to the subsidence of the
bed of porous limestone upon which the Western Valley is
based. Many of these springs intersect the region with rills
and rivulets, and assist in forming a beautiful sheet of water
in the southern suburbs of the city, which eventually pours
out its waters into the Mississippi. Many years ago a dam
and massive mill of stone was erected here by one of the
founders of the city; it is yet standing, surrounded by aged
sycamores, and is more valuable and venerable than ever.
The neighbouring region is abrupt and broken, varied by
a delightful vicissitude of hill and dale. The borders [137]
of the lake are fringed with groves, while the steep bluffs,
which rise along the water and are reflected in its placid
bosom, recall the picture of Ben Venue and Loch Katrine:<a name="FNanchor_114_116" id="FNanchor_114_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_116" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>This beautiful lake and its vicinity is, indeed, unsurpassed
for scenic loveliness by any spot in the suburbs of St. Louis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
At the calm, holy hour of Sabbath sunset, its quiet borders
invite to meditation and retirement. The spot should be
consecrated as the trysting-place of love and friendship.
Some fine structures are rising upon the margin of the
waters, and in a few years it will be rivalled in beauty by
no other section of the city.</p>

<p>St. Louis, like most Western cities, can boast but few
public edifices of any note. Among those which are to be
seen, however, are the large and commodious places of worship
of the different religious denominations; an elegant
courthouse, occupying with its enclosed grounds one of the
finest squares in the city; two market-houses, one of which,
standing upon the river-bank, contains on its second floor
the City Hall; a large and splendid theatre, in most particulars
inferior to no other edifice of the kind in the United
States; and an extensive hotel, which is now going up,
to be called the "St. Louis House," contracted for one
hundred and twenty thousand dollars. The Cathedral of
St. Luke, the University, Hospital, Orphan Asylum, and
the [138] "Convent of the Sacred Heart," are Catholic
Institutions, and well worthy of remark.<a name="FNanchor_115_117" id="FNanchor_115_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_117" class="fnanchor">115</a> For many years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
after its settlement, the Roman Catholic faith prevailed
exclusively in St. Louis. The founders of the city and its
earliest inhabitants were of this religious persuasion; and
their descendants, many of whom are now among its most
opulent and influential citizens, together with foreign immigrants
of a recent date, form a numerous and respectable
body. The names of Chouteau, Pratte, Sarpy, Cabann&eacute;,
Menard, Soulard, &amp;c., &amp;c., are those of early settlers of
the city which yet are often heard.<a name="FNanchor_116_118" id="FNanchor_116_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_118" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>The "Cathedral of St. Luke" is a noble structure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
stone.<a name="FNanchor_117_119" id="FNanchor_117_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_119" class="fnanchor">117</a> It was consecrated with great pomp in the autumn
of '34, having occupied three years in its erection. The
site is unfavourable, but it possessed an interest for many
of the old citizens which no other spot could claim. Here
had stood their ancient sanctuary, with which was associated
the holy feelings of their earliest days; here had been the
baptismal font and the marriage altar; while beneath reposed
the sacred remains of many a being, loved and honoured,
but passed away. The former church was a rude
structure of logs. The dimensions of the present building
are a length of about one hundred and forty feet, to a
breadth of eighty and an altitude of forty, with a tower of
upward of an hundred feet, surmounted by a lofty cross.
The steeple contains a peal of six bells, the three larger of
which were cast in Normandy, and chime very pleasantly;
upon the four sides of the tower are the dial-plates of a clock,
which strikes the hours upon [139] the bells. The porch
of the edifice consists of four large columns of polished freestone,
of the Doric order, with corresponding entablature,
cornice, pediment, and frieze, the whole surface of the latter
being occupied with the inscription "<i>In honorem S. Ludovici.
Deo Uni et Trino, Dicatum, A. D. MDCCCXXXIV</i>,"
the letters elevated in <i>basso-relievo</i>. Over the entrances,
which are three in number, are inscribed, in French and in
English, passages from Scripture, upon tablets of Italian
marble. The porch is protected from the street by battlements,
surmounted by an iron railing, and adorned by lofty
candelabra of stone. The body of the building is divided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
by two colonnades, of five pillars each, into three aisles.
The columns, composed of brick, stuccoed to imitate marble,
are of the Doric order, supporting a cornice and entablature,
decorated with arabesques and medallions; and upon
them reposes the arch of the elliptic-formed and panelled
ceiling. Between the columns are suspended eight splendid
chandeliers, which, when lighted at night, produce a magnificent
effect. The walls are enriched by frescoes and
arabesques, and the windows are embellished with transparencies,
presenting the principal transactions of the Saviour's
mission. This is said to be one of the first attempts at a
substitute for the painted glass of the Middle Ages, and was
executed, together with the other pictorial decorations of
the edifice, by an artist named <i>Leon</i>, sent over for the purpose
from France. The effect is grand. Even the garish
sunbeams are mellowed down as they struggle dimly through
the richly-coloured [140] hangings, and the light throughout
the sacred pile seems tinged with rainbow hues. In the chancel
of the church, at the bottom of the centre aisle, elevated by
a flight of steps, and enclosed by a balustrade of the Corinthian
order, is situated the sanctuary. Upon either side stand
pilasters to represent marble, decorated with festoons of
wheat-ears and vines, symbolical of the eucharist, and surmounted
with caps of the Doric order. On the right, between
the pilasters, is a gallery for the choir, with the organ
in the rear, and on the left side is a veiled gallery for the
"Sisters of Charity" connected with the convent and the
other institutions of the church. The altar-piece at the bottom
of the sanctuary represents the Saviour upon the cross,
with his mother and two of his disciples at his feet; on either
side rise two fluted Corinthian columns, with a broken pediment
and gilded caps, supporting a gorgeous entablature.
Above the whole is an elliptical window, hung with the transparency
of a dove, emblematic of the Holy Ghost, shedding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
abroad rays of light. The high altar and the tabernacle
stand below, and the decorations on festal occasions, as well
as the vestments of the officiating priests, are splendid and
imposing. Over the bishop's seat, in a side arch of the sanctuary,
hangs a beautiful painting of St. Louis, titular of the
cathedral, presented by the amiable Louis XVI. of France
previous to his exile.<a name="FNanchor_118_120" id="FNanchor_118_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_120" class="fnanchor">118</a> At the bottom of each of the side
aisles of the church stand two chapels, at the same elevation
with the sanctuary. Between two fluted columns of the
Ionic order is suspended, in each chapel, an [141] altar-piece,
with a valuable painting above. The piece on the left
represents St. Vincent of Gaul engaged in charity on a
winter's day, and the picture above is the marriage of the
blessed Virgin. The altar-piece of the right represents St.
Patrick of Ireland in his pontifical robes, and above is a
painting of our Saviour and the centurion, said to be by
Paul Veronese. At the opposite extremity of the building,
near the side entrances, are two valuable pieces; one said
to be by Rubens, of the Virgin and Child, the other the
martyrdom of St. Bartholemew.<a name="FNanchor_119_121" id="FNanchor_119_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_121" class="fnanchor">119</a> Above rise extensive
galleries in three rows; to the right is the baptismal font,
and a landscape of the Saviour's immersion in Jordan.
Beneath the sanctuary of the church is the lower chapel,
divided into three aisles by as many arches, supported by
pilasters, which, as well as the walls, are painted to imitate
marble. There is here an altar and a marble tabernacle,
where mass is performed during the week, and the chapel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
is decorated by fourteen paintings, representing different
stages of the Saviour's passion.<a name="FNanchor_120_122" id="FNanchor_120_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_122" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>In the western suburbs of the city, upon an eminence,
stand the buildings of the St. Louis University, handsome
structures of brick.<a name="FNanchor_121_123" id="FNanchor_121_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_123" class="fnanchor">121</a> The institution is conducted by
Jesuits, and most of the higher branches of learning are
taught. The present site has been offered for sale, and the
seminary is to be removed some miles into the interior.
Connected [142] with the college is a medical school of recent
date. The chapel of the institution is a large, airy
room, hung with antique and valuable paintings. Two of
these, suspended on each side of the altar, said to be by
Rubens, are master-pieces of the art. One of them represents
Ignatius Loyola, founder of the order of Jesuits; the
other is the full-length picture of the celebrated Francis
Xavier, apostle to the Indies, who died at Goa while engaged
in his benevolent labours. In an oratory above hangs a
large painting by the same master; a powerful, though unfinished
production. All the galleries of the buildings are
decorated with paintings, some of which have but little to
commend them to notice but their antiquity. The library
embraces about twelve hundred volumes, mostly in the
French language. The <i>Universal Geography</i> of Braviara,
a valuable work of eleven folios, brilliantly illuminated, and
the <i>Act&aelig; Sanctorum</i>, an enormous work of <i>forty-two</i> folio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
volumes, chiefly attract the visiter's attention.<a name="FNanchor_122_124" id="FNanchor_122_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_124" class="fnanchor">122</a> The
philosophical apparatus attached to the institution is
very insufficient. Most of the pupils of the institution
are French, and they are gathered from all quarters of
the South and West; a great number of them are from
Louisiana, sons of the planters.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant afternoon when, in company with a
number of friends, I left the city for an excursion into its
southern suburbs, and a visit to the military works, a few
miles distant. The atmosphere had that mild, mellowy mistiness
which subdues the fierce glare of the sunbeams, and
flings over every object a softened shade. A gentle breeze
from the south was astir balmily and blandly among the
leaves; in fine, it was one of those grateful, genial seasons,
when the senses sympathize with the quietude of external
creation, and there is no reason, earthly or unearthly, why
the inward man should not sympathize with the man with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>out;
a season when you are at peace with yourself, and at
peace with every object, animate, inanimate, or vegetable,
about you. Our party consisted of eight precious souls, and
"all agog to dash through thick and thin," if essential to a
jovial jaunt. And now fain would I enumerate those worthy
individuals, together with their several peculiarities and dispositions,
good and bad, did not a certain delicacy forbid.
[144] Suffice it to say, the excursion was devised in honour,
and for the especial benefit, of a young and recently-married
couple from "the city of monuments and fountains," who
were enjoying their honey-moon in a trip to the Far West.
Passing through the narrow streets and among the ancient
edifices of the <i>old</i> city, we came to that section called South
St. Louis. This is destined to become the district of manufactures;
large quantities of bituminous coal, little inferior
to that of the Alleghanies, is here found; and railroads to
the celebrated Iron Mountain, sixty miles distant, and to
the coal-banks of the Illinois bluffs, as well as to the northern
section of the city, are projected. The landing is good, the
shore being composed of limestone and marble, of two different
species, both of which admit a high degree of polish.
There is also quarried in this vicinity a kind of freestone,
which, when fresh from the bed, is soft, but, on exposure to
the atmosphere, becomes dense and hard. We passed a
number of commodious farmhouses as we ambled along;
and now and then, at intervals through the trees, was caught
a glimpse of the flashing sheen of the river gliding along
upon our left. At a short distance from the road were to
be seen the ruins of the "Eagle Powder-works," destroyed
by fire in the spring of '36. They had been in operation
only three years previous to their explosion, and their daily
manufacture was three hundred pounds of superior powder.
The report and concussion of the explosion was perceived
miles around the country, and the loss sustained by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
proprietors was estimated [145] at forty thousand dollars.
The site of these works was a broad plain, over which, as
our horses were briskly galloping, a circumstance occurred
which could boast quite as much of reality as romance.</p>

<p>To my own especial gallantry&mdash;gallant man&mdash;had been
intrusted the precious person of the fair bride, and lightly
and gracefully pressed her fairy form upon the back of a
bright-eyed, lithe little animal, with a spirit buoyant as her
own. The steed upon which I was myself mounted was a
powerful creature, with a mouth as unyielding as the steel
bit he was constantly champing. The lady prided herself,
not without reason, upon her boldness and grace in horsemanship
and her skill in the <i>man&egrave;ge</i>; and, as we rode somewhat
in advance of our cavalcade, the proposal thoughtlessly
dropped from her that we should elope and leave our companions
in the lurch. Hardly had the syllables left her lip,
than the reins were flung loose upon the horses' manes;
they bounded on, and away, away, away the next moment
were we skirring over the plain, like the steed of the Muses
on a steeple-chase. A single shout of warning to my fair
companion was returned by an ejaculation of terror, for
her horse had become his own master. The race of John
Gilpin or of Alderman Purdy were, either or both of them,
mere circumstances to ours. For more than a mile our
excited steeds swept onward in their furious course to the
admiration of beholders; and how long the race might
have been protracted is impossible to say, had not certain
sons of Erin&mdash;worthy souls [146]&mdash;in the innocence of
their hearts and the ignorance of their heads, and by way
of perpetrating a notable exploit, thought proper to throw
themselves from the roadside directly before us. The
suddenness of the movement brought both our animals
nearly upon their haunches, and the next minute saw the
fair bride quietly seated in the dust beneath their feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
The shock had flung her from her seat, but she arose
uninjured. To leap from my saddle and place the lady
again in hers was the work of a moment; and when the
cort&eacute;ge made its appearance, our runaway steeds were
ambling along in a fashion the most discreet and exemplary
imaginable.</p>

<p>The situation of the Arsenal, upon a swelling bank of the
river, is delightful. It is surrounded by a strong wall of
stone, embracing extensive grounds, through which a green,
shady avenue leads from the highway. The structures are
composed chiefly of unhewn limestone, enclosing a rectangular
area, and comprise about a dozen large buildings, while
a number of lesser ones are perceived here and there among
the groves. The principal structure is one of four stories,
looking down upon the Mississippi, with a beautiful esplanade,
forming a kind of natural glacis to the whole armory,
sweeping away to the water. Upon the right and left, in
the same line with the rectangle, are situated the dwellings
of the officers; noble edifices of hewn stone, with cultivated
garden-plats and fruit-trees. The view of the stream is
here delightful, and the breeze came up from its surface
fresh and free. A pair of pet deer were frolicking along the
shore. Most of the remaining structures are offices and
[147] workshops devoted to the manufacture of arms. Of
these there were but few in the Arsenal, large quantities
having been despatched to the South for the Florida war.
It is designed, I am informed, to mount ordnance at
these works&mdash;to no great extent, probably; there were
several pieces of artillery already prepared. The slits and
loop-holes in the deep walls, the pyramids of balls and
bombshells, and the heavy carronades piled in tiers, give
the place rather a warlike aspect for a peaceable inland
fortress.</p>

<p>A ride of a few miles brought us to the brow of a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>siderable
elevation, from which we looked down upon the
venerable little hamlet of Carondelet, or <i>Vuide Poche</i>, as it
is familiarly termed; a <i>nom de nique</i> truly indicative of the
poverty of pocket and the richness of fancy of its primitive
habitans. The village lies in a sleepy-looking hollow,
scooped out between the bluffs and the water; and from
the summit of the hill the eye glances beyond it over the
lengthened vista of the river-reach, at this place miles in
extent. Along the shore a deeply-laden steamer was toiling
against the current on her passage to the city. Descending
the elevation, we were soon thridding the narrow, tortuous,
lane-like avenues of the old village. Every object, the very
soil even, seemed mossgrown and hoary with time departed.
More than seventy years have passed away since its settlement
commenced; and now, as then, its inhabitants consist
of hunters, and trappers, and river-boatmen, absent most of
the year on their various excursions. The rude, crumbling
tenements [148] of stone or timber, of peculiar structure,
with their whitewashed walls stained by age; the stoccade
enclosures of the gardens; the venerable aspect of the
ancient fruit-trees, mossed with years, and the unique and
singular garb, manner, and appearance of the swarthy villagers,
all betoken an earlier era and a peculiar people.
The little dark-eyed, dark-haired boys were busy with their
games in the streets; and, as we paced leisurely along, we
could perceive in the little <i>cabarets</i> the older portion of the
<i>habitans</i>, cosily congregated around the table near the open
door or upon the balcony, apparently discussing the gossip
of the day and the qualities of sundry potations before them.
Ascending the hill in the rear of the village, we entered the
rude chapel of stone reared upon its brow: the inhabitants
are all Catholics, and to this faith is the edifice consecrated.
The altar-piece, with its decorations, was characterized by
simplicity and taste. Three ancient paintings, representing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
scenes in the mission of the Saviour, were suspended from
the walls; the brass-plated missal reposed upon the tabernacle;
the crucifix rose in the centre of the sanctuary, and
candles were planted on either side. Evergreens were
neatly festooned around the sanctuary, and every object
betrayed a degree of taste. Attached to the church is a
small burial-ground, crowded with tenants. The Sisters
of Charity have an asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, in
a prosperous condition. Our tarry was but a brief one,
as the distrust with which our movements were regarded
by the villagers was evident; nor is this [149] suspicion
at all to be wondered at when we consider the numberless
impostures of which, by immigrants, they have been made
the victims.</p>

<p>A few miles through groves of oaks brought us in view
of that beautiful spot, Jefferson Barracks. The buildings,
constructed of stone, are romantically situated on a bold
bluff, the base of which is swept by the Mississippi, and
were intended to garrison an entire regiment of cavalry
for frontier service. Three sides of the quadrangle of the
parade are bounded by the lines of galleried barracks, with
fine buildings at the extremities for the residence of the
officers; while the fourth opens upon a noble terrace overlooking
the river. The commissary's house, the magazines,
and extensive stables, lie without the parallelogram, beneath
the lofty trees. From the terrace is commanded a fine view
of the river, with its alluvial islands, the extensive woodlands
upon the opposite side, and the pale cliffs of the bluffs
stretching away beyond the bottom. In the rear of the
garrison rises a grove of forest-trees, consisting of heavy
oaks, with broad-spreading branches, and a green, smooth
sward beneath. The surface is beautifully undulating, and
the spot presents a specimen of park scenery as perfect
as the country can boast. A neat burial-ground is located<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in this wood, and the number of its white wooden slabs
gave melancholy evidence of the ravages of the cholera
among that corps of fine fellows which, four years before,
garrisoned the Barracks. Many a one has here laid away
his bones to rest far from the home of his nativity. There
is another cemetery [150] on the southern outskirts of the
Barracks, where are the tombs of several officers of the
army.</p>

<p>The site of Jefferson Barracks was selected by General
Atkinson as the station of a <i>corps de reserve</i>, for defence of
the Southern, Western, and Northern frontiers. For the
purpose of its design, experience has tested its efficiency.
The line of frontier, including the advanced post of
Council Bluffs on the Missouri,<a name="FNanchor_123_125" id="FNanchor_123_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_125" class="fnanchor">123</a> describes the arch of a
circle, the chord of which passes nearly through this point;
and a reserve post here is consequently available for the
entire line of frontier. From its central position and its
proximity to the mouths of the great rivers leading into the
interior, detachments, by means of steam transports, may
be thrown with great rapidity and nearly equal facility
into the garrison upon the Upper Mississippi, the Missouri,
the Arkansas, Red, or Sabine Rivers. This was tested in
the Black Hawk war, and, indeed, in every inroad of the
Indian tribes, these troops have first been summoned to the
field. When disengaged, the spot furnishes a salubrious
position for the reserve of the Western army. By the latest
scheme of frontier defence, a garrison of fifteen hundred
troops is deemed necessary for this cantonment.</p>

<p>A few miles below the Barracks, along the river-bank, is
situated quite a remarkable cave.<a name="FNanchor_124_126" id="FNanchor_124_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_126" class="fnanchor">124</a> I visited and explored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
it one fine afternoon, with a number of friends. With some
difficulty, after repeated inquiry, we succeeded in discovering
the object of our search, and from a neighbouring
farmhouse [151] furnished ourselves with lights and a guide.
The latter was a German, who, according to his own account,
had been something of a hero in his way and day;
he was with Napoleon at Moscow, and was subsequently
taken prisoner by Blucher's Prussian Lancers at Waterloo,
having been wounded in the knee by a musket-ball. To
our edification he detailed a number of his "moving accidents
by flood and field." A few steps from the farmhouse
brought us to the mouth of the cavern, situated in the face
of a ragged limestone precipice nearly a hundred feet high,
and the summit crowned with trees and shrubbery; it forms
the abrupt termination to a ravine, which, united to another
coming in on the right, continues on to the river, a distance
of several hundred yards, through a wood. The entrance
to the cave is exceedingly rough and rugged, piled with
huge fragments of the cliff which have fallen from above,
and it can be approached only with difficulty. It is formed
indeed, by the rocky bed of a stream flowing out from the
cave's mouth, inducing the belief that to this circumstance
the ravine owes its origin. The entrance is formed by a
broad arch about twenty feet in altitude, with twice that
breadth between the abutments. As we entered, the damp
air of the cavern swept out around us chill and penetrating.
An abrupt angle of the wall shut out the daylight, and we
advanced by the light of our candles. The floor, and roof,
and sides of the cavern became exceedingly irregular as we
proceeded, and, after penetrating to the depth of several
hundred yards, [152] the floor and ceiling approached each
other so nearly that we were forced to pursue our way upon
our hands and knees. In some chambers the roof and walls
assumed grotesque and singular shapes, caused by the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
trickling through the porous limestone. In one apartment
was to be seen the exact outline of a human foot of enormous
size; in another, that of an inverted boat; while the vault
in a third assumed the shape of an immense coffin. The
sole proprietors of the cavern seemed the bats, and of these
the number was incredible. In some places the reptiles
suspended themselves like swarms of bees from the roof
and walls; and so compactly one upon the other did they
adhere, that scores could have been crushed at a blow.
After a ramble of more than an hour within these shadowy
realms, during which several false passages upon either side,
soon abruptly terminating, were explored, we at length once
more emerged to the light and warmth of the sunbeams,
thoroughly drenched by the dampness of the atmosphere
and the water dripping from the roof.</p>

<p>Ancient Indian tumuli and graves are often found in
this neighbourhood. On the <i>Rivi&egrave;re des P&egrave;res</i>,<a name="FNanchor_125_127" id="FNanchor_125_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_127" class="fnanchor">125</a> which
is crossed by the road leading to the city, and about
seven miles distant, there are a number of graves which,
from all appearance, seem not to have been disturbed for
centuries. The cemetery is situated on a high bluff looking
down upon the stream, and is said to have contained skeletons
of a gigantic size. Each grave consisted of a shallow
basin, formed by flat stones [153] planted upon their edges;
most of them, however, are mossed by age, or have sunk
beneath the surface, and their tenants have crumbled to
their original dust. Some years since, a Roman coin of a
rare species was found upon the banks of the <i>Rivi&egrave;re des
P&egrave;res</i> by an Indian. This may, perhaps, be classed among
the other antiquities of European origin which are frequently
found. A number of Roman coins, bearing an early date<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of the Christian era, are said to have been discovered in a
cave near Nashville, in the State of Tennessee, which at
the time excited no little interest among antiquaries: they
were doubtless deposited by some of the settlers of the country
from Europe. Settlements on the <i>Rivi&egrave;re des P&egrave;res</i> are
said to have been commenced at an early period by the
Jesuits, and one of them was drowned near its mouth: from
this circumstance it derived its name. In the bed of this
stream, about six miles from the city, is a sulphur spring,
which is powerfully sudorific; and, when taken in any quantity,
throws out an eruption over the whole body. A remarkable
cavern is said to be situated on this river, by some
considered superior to that below the Barracks. A short
distance from <i>Vuide Poche</i> are to be seen the remains of a
pile of ruins, said to be those of a fort erected by La Salle
when, on his second visit, he took possession of the country
in the name of the King of France, and in honour of him
called it Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_126_128" id="FNanchor_126_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_128" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>There are few things more delightfully refreshing, amid
the fierce fervour of midsummer, than to forsake the stifled,
polluted atmosphere of the city for the cool breezes of its
forest suburbs. A freshened elasticity seems gliding through
the languid system, bracing up the prostrated fibres of the
frame; the nerves thrill with renewed tensity, and the vital
flood courses in fuller gush, and leaps onward with more
bounding buoyancy in its fevered channels. Every one has
experienced this; and it was under circumstances like these
that I found myself one bright day, after a delay at St. Louis
which began at length to be intolerably tedious, forsaking
the sultry, sun-scorched streets of [155] the city, and crossing
the turbid flood for a tour upon the prairies of Illinois. How
delightful to a frame just freed from the feverish confinement
of a sick-chamber, brief though it had been, was the
fresh breeze which came careering over the water, rippling
along the polished surface, and gayly riding the miniature
waves of its own creation! The finest point from which to
view the little "City of the French" is from beneath the
enormous sycamores upon the opposite bank of the Mississippi.
It is from this spot alone that anything approaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to a cosmorama can be commanded. The city, retreating
as it does from the river's brink&mdash;its buildings of every
diversity of form, material, and structure, promiscuously
heaped the one upon the other, and the whole intermingled
with the fresh green of forest-trees, may boast of much scenic
beauty. The range of white limestone warehouses, circling
like a crescent the shore, form the most prominent feature
of the foreground, while the forest of shrub-oaks sweeps
away in the rear. For some time I gazed upon this imposing
view, and then, slowly turning my horse's head, was upon
the dusty thoroughfare to Edwardsville. For the first time
I found myself upon the celebrated "American Bottom,"
a tract of country which, for fertility and depth of soil,
is perhaps unsurpassed in the world. A fine road of
baked loam extended along my route. Crossing Cahokia
Creek, which cuts its deep bed diagonally through the
bottom from the bluffs some six miles distant, and threading
a grove of the beautiful <i>pecan</i>, with its long trailing
boughs and [156] delicate leaves, my path was soon winding
gracefully away among those venerable monuments of a race
now passed from the earth. The eye is struck at first by the
number of these eminences, as well as by their symmetry
of form and regularity of outline; and the most familiar
resemblance suggested is that of gigantic hay-ricks sprinkled
over the uniform surface of the prairie on every side. As
you advance, however, into the plain, leaving the range
of mounds upon the left, something of arrangement is detected
in their relative position; and a design too palpable
is betrayed to mistake them for the handiwork of Nature.
Upward of one hundred of these mounds, it is stated, may
be enumerated within seven miles of St. Louis, their altitude
varying from ten to sixty feet, with a circumference at
the base of about as many yards. One of these, nearly in
the centre of the first collection, is remarked as considerably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
larger than those around, and from its summit is commanded
an extensive view of the scene. The group embraces, perhaps,
fifty tumuli, sweeping off from opposite the city to the
northeast, in form of a crescent, parallel to the river, and at
a distance from it of about one mile: they extend about the
same distance, and a belt of forest alone obstructs their view
from the city. When this is removed, and the prairie is
under cultivation, the scene laid open must be beautiful.
The outline of the mounds is ordinarily that of a gracefully-rounded
cone of varying declivity, though often the form is
oblong, approaching the rectangle or ellipse. In some instances
[157] they are perfectly square, with a level area
upon the summit sufficient for a dwelling and the necessary
purlieus. Most of them are clothed with dense thickets and
the coarse grass of the bottom; while here and there stands
out an aged oak, rooted in the mould, tossing its green head
proudly to the breeze, its rough bark shaggy with moss,
and the pensile parasite flaunting from its branches.
Some few of the tumuli, however, are quite naked, and
present a rounded, beautiful surface from the surrounding
plain. At this point, about half a mile from the river-bank,
commencing with the first group of mounds, extends
the railroad across the bottom to the bluffs. The expense
of this work was considerable. It crosses a lake, into
the bed of which piles were forced a depth of ninety
feet before a foundation for the tracks sufficiently firm
could be obtained. Coal is transported to St. Louis upon
this railway direct from the mines; and the beneficial effects
to be anticipated from it in other respects are very
great. A town called <i>Pittsburg</i> has been laid out at the
foot of the coal bluffs.<a name="FNanchor_127_129" id="FNanchor_127_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_129" class="fnanchor">127</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the first collection of tumuli, the road wound
away smooth and uniform through the level prairie, with
here and there upon the left a slight elevation from its low
surface, seeming a continuation of the group behind, or a
link of union to those yet before. It was a sweet afternoon;
the atmosphere was still and calm, and summer's
golden haze was sleeping magnificently on the far-off bluffs.
At intervals the soft breath of the "sweet South" [158]
came dancing over the tall, glossy herbage, and the many-hued
prairie-flowers flashed gayly in the sunlight. There
was the <i>heliotrope</i>, in all its gaudy but magnificent forms;
there the deep cerulean of the fringed <i>gentiana</i>, delicate as
an iris; there the mellow gorgeousness of the <i>solidago</i>, in some
spots along the pathway, spreading out itself, as it were, into
a perfect "field of the cloth of gold;" and the balmy
fragrance of the aromatic wild thyme or the burgamot,
scattered in rich profusion over the plain, floated over all.
Small coveys of the prairie-fowl, <i>tetrao pratensis</i>, a fine
species of grouse, the ungainly form of the partridge, or
that of the timid little hare, would appear for a moment in
the dusty road, and, on my nearer approach, away they
hurriedly scudded beneath the friendly covert of the bright-leaved
sumach or the thickets of the rosebush. Extensive
groves of the wild plum and the crab-apple, bending beneath
the profusion of clustering fruitage, succeeded each other for
miles along the path as I rode onward; now extending in
continuous thickets, and then swelling up like green islets
from the surface of the plain, their cool recesses affording a
refreshing shade for the numerous herds. The rude farmhouse,
too, with its ruder outbuildings, half buried in the
dark luxuriance of its maize-fields, from time to time was
seen along the route.</p>

<p>After a delightful drive of half an hour the second group
of eminences, known as the "Cantine Mounds," appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
upon the prairie at a distance of three or four miles, the
celebrated "Monk Hill," largest monument of the kind
yet discovered in North America, heaving up its giant,
forest-clothed [159] form in the midst.<a name="FNanchor_128_130" id="FNanchor_128_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_130" class="fnanchor">128</a> What are the
reflections to which this stupendous earth-heap gives birth?
What the associations which throng the excited fancy?
What a field for conjecture! What a boundless range for
the workings of imagination! What eye can view this
venerable monument of the past, this mighty landmark in
the lapse of ages, this gray chronicler of hoary centuries,
and turn away uninterested?</p>

<p>As it is first beheld, surrounded by the lesser heaps, it is
mistaken by the traveller for an elevation of natural origin:
as he draws nigh, and at length stands at the base, its stupendous
magnitude, its lofty summit, towering above his
head and throwing its broad shadow far across the meadow;
its slopes ploughed with yawning ravines by the torrents of
centuries descending to the plain; its surface and declivities
perforated by the habitations of burrowing animals,
and carpeted with tangled thickets; the vast size of the aged
oaks rearing themselves from its soil; and, finally, the farmhouse,
with its various structures, its garden, and orchard,
and <i>well</i> rising upon the broad area of the summit, and the
carriage pathway winding up from the base, all confirm his
impression that no hand but that of the Mightiest could
have reared the enormous mass. At that moment, should
he be assured that this vast earth-heap was of origin demon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>strably
artificial, he would smile; but credulity the most
sanguine would fail to credit the assertion. But when, with
jealous eye, slowly and cautiously, and with measured footsteps,
he has circled its base; when he has surveyed its
slopes and declivities from every position, and has [160]
remarked the peculiar uniformity of its structure and the
mathematical exactitude of its outline; when he has ascended
to its summit, and looked round upon the piles of a similar
character by which it is surrounded; when he has taken
into consideration its situation upon a river-bottom of
nature decidedly diluvial, and, of consequence, utterly incompatible
with the <i>natural</i> origin of such elevations; when
he has examined the soil of which it is composed, and has
discovered it to be uniformly, throughout the entire mass,
of the same mellow and friable species as that of the prairie
at its base; and when he has listened with scrutiny to the
facts which an examination of its depths has thrown to light
of its nature and its contents, he is compelled, however
reluctantly, yet without a doubt, to declare that the gigantic
pile is incontestibly the <span class="smcap">workmanship of man's hand</span>.
But, with such an admission, what is the crowd of reflections
which throng and startle the mind? What a series of
unanswerable inquiries succeed! When was this stupendous
earth-heap reared up from the plain? By what race of
beings was the vast undertaking accomplished? What was
its purpose? What changes in its form and magnitude have
taken place? What vicissitudes and revolutions have, in
the lapse of centuries, rolled like successive waves over the
plains at its base? As we reflect, we anxiously look around
us for some tradition, some time-stained chronicle, some
age-worn record, even the faintest and most unsatisfactory
legend, upon which to repose our credulity, and
relieve the inquiring solicitude of the mind. But [161] our
research is hopeless. The present race of aborigines can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
tell nothing of these tumuli. To them, as to us, they are
veiled in mystery. Ages since, long ere the white-face
came, while this fair land was yet the home of his fathers,
the simple Indian stood before this venerable earth-heap,
and gazed, and wondered, and turned away.</p>

<p>But there is another reflection which, as we gaze upon
these venerable tombs, addresses itself directly to our feelings,
and bows them in humbleness. It is, that soon <i>our</i>
memory and that of our <i>own</i> generation will, like that of
other times and other men, have passed away; that when
these frail tenements shall have been laid aside to moulder,
the remembrance will soon follow them to the land of forgetfulness.
Ah, if there be an object in all the wide universe
of human desires for which the heart of man yearns
with an intensity of craving more agonizing and deathless
than for any other, it is that the memory should live after the
poor body is dust. It was this eternal principle of our nature
which reared the lonely tombs of Egypt amid the sands
and barrenness of the desert. For ages untold have the
massive and gloomy pyramids looked down upon the floods
of the Nile, and generation after generation has passed away;
yet their very existence still remains a mystery, and their
origin points down our inquiry far beyond the grasp of
human ken, into the boiling mists, the "wide involving
shades" of centuries past. And yet how fondly did they
who, with the toil, and blood, and sweat, and misery of
ages, upreared these stupendous piles, anticipate [162] an
immortality for their name which, like the effulgence of a
golden eternity, should for ever linger around their summits!
So was it with the ancient tomb-builders of this New World;
so has it been with man in every stage of his existence, from
the hour that the giant Babel first reared its dusky walls
from the plains of Shinar down to the era of the present
generation. And yet how hopeless, desperately, eternally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
hopeless are such aspirations of the children of men! As
nations or as individuals, our memory we can never embalm!
A few, indeed, may retain the forlorn relic within the sanctuary
of hearts which loved us while with them, and that
with a tenderness stronger than death; but, with the great
mass of mankind, our absence can be noticed only for a
day; and then the ranks close up, and a gravestone tells
the passing stranger that we lived and died: a few years&mdash;the
finger of time has been busy with the inscription, and
we are <i>as if we had never been</i>. If, then, it must be even so,</p>

<p>The antiquity of "Monk Mound" is a circumstance
which fails not to arrest the attention of every visiter.
That centuries have elapsed since this vast pile of earth was
heaped up from the plain, no one can doubt: every circumstance,
even the most minute and inconsiderable, confirms
an idea which the venerable oaks upon its soil conclusively
demonstrate. With this premise admitted, consider for a
moment the destructive effects of the elements even for a
limited period upon the works of our race. Little more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
than half a century has elapsed since the war of our revolution;
but where are the fortifications, and parapets, and
military defences then thrown up? The earthy ramparts
of Bunker Hill were nearly obliterated long ago by the
levelling finger of time, and scarce a vestige now remains
to assist in tracing out the line of defence. The same is
true with these works all over the country; and even those
of the last war&mdash;those at Baltimore, for example [164]&mdash;are
vanishing as fast as the elements can melt them away.
Reflect, then, that this vast earth-heap of which I am
writing is composed of a soil far more yielding in its nature
than they; that its superfices are by no means compact;
and then conceive, if you <i>can</i>, its stupendous character
before it had bided the rains, and snows, and storm-winds
of centuries, and before the sweeping floods of the "Father
of Waters" had ever circled its base. Our thoughts are
carried back by the reflection to the era of classic fiction,
and we almost fancy another war of the Titans against the
heavens&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Conati imponere Pelio Ossam&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noidt">if a quotation from the sweet bard of Mantua, upon a topic
like the present, may be pardoned. How large an army
of labourers, without the use of iron utensils, as we have
every reason to suppose was the case, would be required
for scraping up from the prairie's surface this huge pile;
and how many years would suffice for its completion? No
one can doubt that the broad surface of the American Bottom,
in its whole length and breadth, together with all the
neighbouring region on either bank of the Mississippi, once
swarmed with living men and animals, even as does now
the depths of its soil with their remains. The collection of
mounds which I have been attempting to describe would
seem to indicate two extensive cities within the extent of five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
miles; and other groups of the same character may be seen
upon a lower section of the bottom, to say nothing of those
within the more immediate vicinity of St. [165] Louis. The
design of these mounds, as has been before stated, was
various, undoubtedly; many were sepulchres, some fortifications,
some watch-towers or videttes, and some of the
larger class, among which we would place Monk Hill, were
probably devoted to the ceremonies of religion.</p>

<p>The number of the earth-heaps known as the Cantine
Mounds is about fifty, small and great. They lie very irregularly
along the southern and eastern bank of Cahokia
Creek, occupying an area of some miles in circuit. They
are of every form and every size, from the mere molehill,
perceptible only by a deeper shade in the herbage, to the
gigantic Monk Mound, of which I have already said so
much. This vast heap stands about one hundred yards
from the creek, and the slope which faces it is very precipitous,
and clothed with aged timber. The area of the
base is about six hundred yards in circumference, and the
perpendicular altitude has been estimated at from ninety to
upward of a hundred feet. The form is that of a rectangle,
lying north and south; and upon the latter extremity, which
commands a view down the bottom, is spread out a broad
terrace, or rather a steppe to the main body, about twenty
feet lower than the summit, extending the whole length of
the side, and is one hundred and fifty feet in breadth. At
the left extremity of this terrace winds up the sloping
pathway from the prairie to the summit of the mound.
Formerly this road sloped up an inclined plane, projecting
from the middle of the terrace, ten feet in breadth and
twenty in extent, and seemed graded for that purpose at
[166] the erection of the mound. This declivity yet remains,
but now forms part of a corn-field.</p>

<p>The view from the southern extremity of the mound, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
is free from trees and underbrush, is extremely beautiful.
Away to the south sweeps off the broad river-bottom, at this
place about seven miles in width, its waving surface variegated
by all the magnificent hues of the summer Flora of
the prairies. At intervals, from the deep herbage is flung
back the flashing sheen of a silvery lake to the oblique
sunlight; while dense groves of the crab-apple and other
indigenous wild fruits are sprinkled about like islets in the
verdant sea. To the left, at a distance of three or four
miles, stretches away the long line of bluffs, now presenting
a surface naked and rounded by groups of mounds, and
now wooded to their summits, while a glimpse at times may
be caught of the humble farmhouses at their base. On
the right meanders the Cantine Creek, which gives the name
to the group of mounds, betraying at intervals its bright
surface through the belt of forest by which it is margined.
In this direction, far away in the blue distance, rising through
the mist and forest, may be caught a glimpse of the spires
and cupolas of the city, glancing gayly in the rich summer
sun. The base of the mound is circled upon every side by
lesser elevations of every form and at various distances. Of
these, some lie in the heart of the extensive maize-fields,
which constitute the farm of the proprietor of the principal
mound, presenting a beautiful exhibition of light and shade,
shrouded as they are in the dark, twinkling leaves. The
most [167] remarkable are two standing directly opposite the
southern extremity of the principal one, at a distance of
some hundred yards, in close proximity to each other, and
which never fail to arrest the eye. There are also several
large square mounds covered with forest along the margin
of the creek to the right, and groups are caught rising from
the declivities of the distant bluffs.</p>

<p>Upon the western side of Monk Mound, at a distance of
several yards from the summit, is a well some eighty or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
ninety feet in depth; the water of which would be agreeable
enough were not the presence of sulphur, in some of
its modifications, so palpable. This well penetrates the
heart of the mound, yet, from its depth, cannot reach lower
than the level of the surrounding plain. I learned, upon
inquiry, that when this well was excavated, several fragments
of pottery, of decayed ears of corn, and other
articles, were thrown up from a depth of sixty-five feet;
proof incontestible of the artificial structure of the mound.
The associations, when drinking the water of this well,
united with its peculiar flavour, are not of the most
exquisite character, when we reflect that the precious fluid
has probably filtrated, part of it, at least, through the
contents of a sepulchre. The present proprietor is about
making a transfer, I was informed, of the whole tract to
a gentleman of St. Louis, who intends establishing here
a house of entertainment. If this design is carried into
effect, the drive to this place will be the most delightful
in the vicinity of the city.</p>

<p>Monk Mound has derived its name and much of [168]
its notoriety from the circumstance that, in the early part
of the present century, for a number of years, it was the
residence of a society of ecclesiastics, of the order <i>La
Trappe</i>, the most ascetic of all the monastic denominations.
The monastery of La Trappe was originally situated in the
old province of Perche, in the territory of Orleannois, in
France, which now, with a section of Normandy, constitutes
the department of Orne. Its site is said to have been
the loneliest and most desolate spot that could be selected
in the kingdom. The order was founded in 1140 by Rotrou,
count of Perche; but having fallen into decay, and
its discipline having become much relaxed, it was reformed
in 1664, five centuries subsequent, by the Abb&eacute; Armand
Rance. This celebrated ecclesiastic, history informs us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was in early life a man of fashion and accomplishments;
of splendid abilities, distinguished as a classical scholar and
translator of Anacreon's Odes. At length, the sudden death
of his mistress Montbazon, to whom he was extremely attached,
so affected him that he forsook at once his libertine
life, banished himself from society, and introduced into the
monastery of La Trappe an austerity of discipline hitherto
unknown.<a name="FNanchor_129_131" id="FNanchor_129_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_131" class="fnanchor">129</a> The vows were chastity, poverty, obedience,
and perpetual silence. The couch was a slab of stone, the
diet water and bread once in twenty-four hours, and each
member removed a spadeful of earth every day from the
spot of his intended grave. The following passage relative
to this monastery I find quoted from an old French author;
and as the [169] language and sentiments are forcible,
I need hardly apologize for introducing it entire.</p>

<p>"<i>C'est la que se retirent, ceux qui out commis quelque
crime secret, dont les remords les poursuivent; ceux qui sont
tourmentes de vapeurs m&eacute;lancoliques et religieuse; ceux qui
ont oublie que Dieu est le plus mis&eacute;ricordieux des p&egrave;res, et
qui ne voient en lui, que le plus cruel des tyrans; ceux qui
reduisent &agrave; vieu, les souffrances, la mort et la passion de Jesu
Crist, et qui ne voient la religion que du cote effrayent et
terrible: c'est la que sont pratique des austerite qui abregent la
vie, et sont injure &agrave; la divinit&eacute;.</i>"</p>

<p>During the era of the Reign of Terror in France, the
monks of La Trappe, as well as all the other orders of
priesthood, were dispersed over Europe. They increased
greatly, however, notwithstanding persecution, and societies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
established themselves in England and Germany. From
the latter country emigrated the society which planted
themselves upon the American Bottom. They first settled
in the State of Kentucky; subsequently they established
themselves at the little French hamlet of Florisant, and in
1809 they crossed the Mississippi, and, strangely enough,
selected for their residence the spot I have been describing.<a name="FNanchor_130_132" id="FNanchor_130_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_132" class="fnanchor">130</a>
Here they made a purchase of about four hundred
acres, and petitioned Congress for a pre-emption right to
some thousands adjoining. The buildings which they occupied
were never of a very durable character, but consisted
of about half a dozen large structures of logs, on the summit
of the mound about fifty yards to the right [170] of
the largest. This is twenty feet in height, and upward of a
hundred and fifty feet square; a well dug by the Trappists
is yet to be seen, though the whole mound is now buried in
thickets. Their outbuildings, stables, granaries, &amp;c., which
were numerous, lay scattered about on the plain below.
Subsequently they erected an extensive structure upon the
terrace of the principal mound, and cultivated its soil for a
kitchen-garden, while the area of the summit was sown
with wheat. Their territory under cultivation consisted of
about one hundred acres, divided into three fields, and
embracing several of the mounds.</p>

<p>The society of the Trappists consisted of about eighty
monks, chiefly Germans and French, with a few of our own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
countrymen, under governance of one of their number called
Father Urbain.<a name="FNanchor_131_133" id="FNanchor_131_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_133" class="fnanchor">131</a> Had they remained, they anticipated an
accession to their number of about two hundred monks
from Europe. Their discipline was equally severe with that
of the order in ancient times. Their diet was confined to
vegetables, and of these they partook sparingly but once in
twenty-four hours: the stern vow of perpetual silence was
upon them; no female was permitted to violate their retreat,
and they dug their own graves. Their location, however,
they found by no means favourable to health, notwithstanding
the severe simplicity of their habits. During the
summer months fevers prevailed among them to an alarming
extent; few escaped, and many died. Among the latter
was Louis Antoine Langlois, a native of Quebec, more
familiarly known as Fran&ccedil;ois [171] Marie Bernard, the
name he assumed upon entering the monastery. He often
officiated in the former Catholic church of St. Louis, and
is still remembered by the older French inhabitants with
warm emotions, as he was greatly beloved.</p>

<p>The Trappists are said to have been extremely industrious,
and some of them skilful workmen at various arts, particularly
that of watchmaking; insomuch that they far excelled
the same craft in the city, and were patronised by all the
unruly timepieces in the region. They had also a laboratory
of some extent, and a library; but the latter, we are informed,
was of no marvellous repute, embracing chiefly the
day-dreams of the Middle Ages, and the wondrous doings
of the legion of saints, together with a few obsolete works
on medicine. Connected with the monastery was a seminary
for the instruction of boys; or, rather, it was a sort of
asylum for the orphan, the desolate, the friendless, the halt,
the blind, the deaf, and the dumb, and also for the aged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and destitute of the male sex. They subjected their pupils
to the same severe discipline which they imposed upon themselves.
They were permitted to use their tongues but two
hours a day, and then very <i>judiciously</i>: instead of exercising
that "unruly member," they were taught by the good fathers
to gesticulate with their fingers at each other in marvellous
fashion, and thus to communicate their ideas. As to juvenile
sports and the frolics of boyhood, it was a sin to dream
of such things. They all received an apprenticeship to some
useful trade, however, and were no doubt trained [172] up
most innocently and ignorantly in the way they should go.
The pupils were chiefly sons of the settlers in the vicinity;
but whether they were fashioned by the worthy fathers into
good American citizens or the contrary, tradition telleth
not. Tradition doth present, however, sundry allegations
prejudicial to the honest monks, which we are bold to say
is all slander, and unworthy of credence. Some old gossips
of the day hesitated not to affirm that the monks were
marvellously filthy in their habits; others, that they were
prodigiously keen in their bargains; a third class, that the
younger members were not so obdurate towards the gentler
part of creation as they <i>might have been</i>; while the whole
community round about, <i>una voce</i>, chimed in, and solemnly
declared that men who neither might, could, would, or should
speak, were a little worse than dumb brutes, and ought to
be treated accordingly. However this may have been, it
is pretty certain, as is usually the case with our dear fellow-creatures
where they are permitted to know nothing at all
about a particular matter, the good people, in the overflowings
of worldly charity, imagined all manner of evil against the
poor Trappist, and seemed to think they had a perfect right
to violate his property and insult his person whenever they,
in their wisdom and kind feeling, thought proper to do so.
But this was soon at an end. In 1813 the monks disposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of their personal property, and leaving fever and ague to
their persecutors, and the old mounds to their primitive
solitude, forsook the country and sailed for France.</p>

<p>[173] Though it is not easy to palliate the unceremonious
welcome with which the unfortunate Trappist was favoured
at the hand of our people, yet we can readily appreciate
the feelings which prompted their ungenerous conduct.
How strange, how exceedingly strange must it have seemed
to behold these men, in the garb and guise of a distant land,
uttering, when their lips broke the silence in which they
were locked, the unknown syllables of a foreign tongue;
professing an austere, an ancient, and remarkable faith;
denying themselves, with the sternest severity, the simplest
of Nature's bounties; how strange must it have seemed to
behold these men establishing themselves in the depths of
this Western wilderness, and, by a fortuitous concurrence
of events, planting their altars and hearths upon the very
tombs of a race whose fate is veiled in mystery, and practising
their austerities at the forsaken temple of a forgotten worship!
How strange to behold the devotees of a faith, the
most artificial in its ceremonies among men, bowing themselves
upon the high places reared up by the hands of those
who worshipped the Great Spirit after the simplest form of
Nature's adoration! For centuries this singular order of
men had figured upon the iron page of history; their legends
had shadowed with mystery the bright leaf of poetry and
romance, and with them were associated many a wild vision
of fancy. And here they were, mysterious as ever, with
cowl, and crucifix, and shaven head, and the hairy "crown
of thorns" encircling; ecclesiastics the most severe of all
the orders of monarchism. How strange must it all [174]
have seemed! and it is hardly to be wondered at, unpopular
as such institutions undoubtedly were and ever have been
in this blessed land of ours, that a feeling of intolerance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and suspicion, and prejudice should have existed. It is not
a maxim of <i>recent</i> date in the minds of men, that "whatever
is peculiar is false."</p>

<p>There are few lovelier villages in the Valley of the West
than the little town of Edwardsville, in whose quiet inn
many of the preceding observations have been sketched.<a name="FNanchor_132_134" id="FNanchor_132_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_134" class="fnanchor">132</a>
It was early one bright morning that I entered Edwardsville,
after passing a sleepless night at a neighbouring farmhouse.
The situation of the village is a narrow ridge of
[175] land swelling abruptly from the midst of deep and tangled
woods. Along this elevation extends the principal
street of the place, more than a mile in length, and upon
either side runs a range of neat edifices, most of them shaded
by forest-trees in their front yards. The public buildings
are a courthouse and jail of brick, neither of them worthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of farther mention, and two plain, towerless churches, imbosomed
in a grove somewhat in the suburbs of the village.
There is something singularly picturesque in the situation
of these churches, and the structures themselves are not devoid
of beauty and symmetrical proportion. At this place,
also, is located the land-office for the district. On the morning
of my arrival at the village, early as was the hour, the
place was thronged with disappointed applicants for land;
a lean and hungry-looking race, by-the-by, as it has ever
been my lot to look upon. Unfortunately, the office had
the evening before, from some cause, been closed, and the
unhappy speculators were forced to trudge away many a
weary mile, through dust and sun, with their heavy specie
dollars, to their homes again. I remember once to have
been in the city of Bangor, "away down East in the State
of Maine," when the public lands on the Penobscot River
were first placed in the market. The land mania had for
some months been running high, but could hardly be said
yet to have reached a crisis. From all quarters of the Union
speculators had been hurrying to the place; and day and
night, for the week past, the steamers had been disgorging
upon the city their ravenous freights. The important [176]
day arrived. At an early hour every hotel, and street, and
avenue was swarming with strangers; and, mingling with
the current of living bodies, which now set steadily onward
to the place of sale, I was carried resistlessly on by its force
till it ceased. A confused murmur of voices ran through
the assembled thousands; and amid the tumult, the ominous
words "<i>land&mdash;lumber&mdash;title-deed</i>," and the like, could
alone be distinguished. At length, near noon, the clear
tones of the auctioneer were heard rising above the hum of
the multitude: all was instantly hushed and still; and gaining
an elevated site, before me was spread out a scene worthy
a Hogarth's genius and pencil. Such a mass of working,
agitated features, glaring with the fierce passion of avarice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and the basest propensities of humanity, one seldom is fated
to witness. During that public land-sale, indeed, I beheld
so much of the selfishness, the petty meanness, the detestable
heartlessness of man's nature, that I turned away disgusted,
sick at heart for the race of which I was a member.
We are reproached as a nation by Europeans for the contemptible
vice of avarice; is the censure unjust? Parson
Taylor tells us that Satan was the first speculator in land, for
on a certain occasion he took Jesus up into an exceedingly
high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the earth
and the glory thereof, and said to him, "All these things
will I give to thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me,"
when, in fact, the devil did not own one inch of land to give!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Think of the devil's brazen phiz,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When not an inch of land was his!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">[177] Yet it is to be apprehended that not a few in our midst
would not hesitate to barter soul and body, and fall down
in worship, were a sufficient number of <i>acres</i> spread out
before them as the recompense.</p>

<p>Among other objects worthy the traveller's notice in
passing through Edwardsville is a press for the manufacture
of that well-known, agreeable liquid, <i>castor oil</i>: it is situated
within the precincts of what is termed, for distinction, the
"Upper Village." The apparatus, by means of which the
oil is expressed from the bean and clarified, is extremely
simple, consisting merely of the ordinary jack-screw. One
bushel of the castor beans&mdash;<i>palma Christi</i>&mdash;yields nearly
two gallons of the liquid. The only previous preparation
to pressing is to dry the beans in an oven. This establishment<a name="FNanchor_133_135" id="FNanchor_133_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_135" class="fnanchor">133</a>
has been in operation upward of ten years, and has
rendered its proprietor, Mr. Adams, a wealthy man.<a name="FNanchor_134_136" id="FNanchor_134_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_136" class="fnanchor">134</a> He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
has a delightful villa, with grounds laid out with taste; and
though many years have passed away since he left his native
New-England, yet the generosity of his heart and the
benevolence of his character tell truly that he has not yet
ceased the remembrance of early principles and habits.
The village of Edwardsville and its vicinity are said to be
remarkably healthy; and the location in the heart of a fertile,
well-watered, heavily-timbered section of country, tilled
by a race of enterprising yeomanry, gives promise of rapid
advancement. The town plat was first laid off in 1815; but
the place advanced but little in importance until five years
afterward, when a new [178] town was united to the old.
About twelve miles southeast from Edwardsville is situated
the delightful little hamlet of Collinsville, named from its
founder, to which I paid a hasty visit during my ramble
on the prairies.<a name="FNanchor_135_137" id="FNanchor_135_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_137" class="fnanchor">135</a> It was settled many years ago, but till
very recently had not assumed the dignity of a town. Its
site is the broad, uniform surface of an elevated ridge, ascending
gently from the American Bottom, beautifully shaded
by forest-trees, and extending into the interior for several
miles. It is almost entirely settled by northern emigrants,
whose peculiarities are nowhere more strikingly exhibited.
Much attention is bestowed upon religion and education;
not a grocery exists in the place, nor, by the charter of the
town, can one be established for several years. This little
village presents a delightful summer-retreat to the citizens
of St. Louis, only ten miles distant.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet risen when I left Edwardsville, after
a pleasant visit, and, descending into the Bottom, pursued
my route over the plain to Alton. The face of the country,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
for a portion of the way, is broken, and covered with
forests of noble trees, until the traveller finds himself on
the deep sand-plains, stretching away for some miles, and
giving support to a stunted, scragged growth of shrub-oaks.
The region bears palpable evidence of having been, at no
distant period, submerged; and the idea is confirmed by
the existence, at the present time, of a lake of considerable
extent on the southern border, which, from the character
of the surface, a slight addition of water would spread for
miles. I shall not [179] soon forget, I think, the day I
entered Alton for the second time during my ramble in
the West. It was near the noon after an exceedingly
sultry morning; and the earth beneath my horse's hoofs was
reduced by protracted drought to an impalpable powder
to the depth of several inches. The blazing sunbeams,
veiled by not a solitary cloud, reflected from the glassy
surface of the Mississippi as from the face of an immense
steely mirror and again thrown back by the range of beetling
bluffs above, seemed converged into an intense burning focus
along the scorched-up streets and glowing roofs of the
village. I have endured heat, but none more intolerable
in the course of my life than that of which I speak.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the sultriness of the day was over,
passing through the principal street of the town, I ascended
that singular range of bluffs which, commencing at this
point, extend along the river, and to which, on a former
occasion, I have briefly alluded. The ascent is arduous,
but the glorious view from the summit richly repays the visiter
for his toil. The withering atmosphere of the depressed,
sunburnt village at my feet was delightfully exchanged
for the invigorating breezes of the hills, as the fresh evening
wind came wandering up from the waters. It was the
sunset hour. The golden, slanting beams of departing day
were reflected from the undulating bosom of the river,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
as its bright waters stretched away among the western
forests, as if from a sea of molten, gliding silver. On the
left, directly at your feet, reposes the village of Alton, overhung
by hills, with the gloomy, castellated [180] walls of the
Penitentiary lifting up their dusky outline upon its skirts,
presenting to the eye a perfect panorama as you look down
upon the tortuous streets, the extensive warehouses of stone,
and the range of steamers, alive with bustle, along the landing.
Beyond the village extends a deep forest; while a little
to the south sweep off the waters of the river, bespangled
with green islands, until, gracefully expanding itself, a noble
bend withdraws it from the view. It is at this point that the
Missouri disgorges its turbid, heavy mass of waters into the
clear floods of the Upper Mississippi, hitherto uncheckered
by a stain. At the base of the bluffs, upon which you
stand, at an elevation of a hundred and fifty feet, rushes with
violence along the crags the current of the stream; while
beyond, upon the opposite plain, is beheld the log hut of the
emigrant couched beneath the enormous sycamores, and
sending up its undulating thread of blue, curling smoke
through the lofty branches. A lumber steam-mill is also
here to be seen. Beyond these objects the eye wanders
over an interminable carpet of forest-tops, stretching away
till they form a wavy line of dense foliage circling the western
horizon. By the aid of a glass, a range of hills, blue in the
distance, is perceived outlined against the sky: they are the
bluffs skirting the beautiful valley of the Missouri. The
heights from which this view is commanded are composed
principally of earth heaped upon a massive ledge of limerock,
which elevates itself from the very bed of the waters.
As the spectator gazes and reflects, he cannot but be amazed
that the [181] rains, and snows, and torrents of centuries
have not, with all their washings, yet swept these earth-heaps
away, though the deep ravines between the mounds, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
probably originated their present peculiar form, give proof
conclusive that such diluvial action to some extent has long
been going on. As is usually found to be the case, the
present race of Indians have availed themselves of these
elevated summits for the burial-spots of their chiefs. I myself
scraped up a few decaying fragments of bones, which
lay just beneath the surface.</p>

<p>At sunrise of the morning succeeding my visit to the bluffs
I was in the saddle, and clambering up those intolerably
steep hills on the road leading to the village of Upper Alton,
a few miles distant. The place is well situated upon an
elevated prairie; and, to my own taste, is preferable far for
private residence to any spot within the precincts of its rival
namesake. The society is polished, and a fine-toned morality
is said to characterize the inhabitants. The town was
originally incorporated many years ago, and was then a place
of more note than it has ever since been; but, owing to intestine
broils and conflicting claims to its site, it gradually
and steadily dwindled away, until, a dozen years since, it
numbered only <i>seven</i> families. A suit in chancery has happily
settled these difficulties, and the village is now thriving
well. A seminary of some note, under jurisdiction of the
Baptist persuasion, has within a few years been established
here, and now comprises a very respectable body of students.<a name="FNanchor_136_138" id="FNanchor_136_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_138" class="fnanchor">136</a>
It originated in a seminary [182] formerly estab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>lished
at Rock Spring in this state. About five years since
a company of gentlemen, seven in number, purchased here
a tract of several hundred acres, and erected upon it an academical
edifice of brick; subsequently a stone building was
erected, and a preparatory school instituted. In the year
1835, funds to a considerable amount were obtained at the
East; and a donation of $10,000 from Dr. Benjamin Shurtliff,
of Boston, induced the trustees to give to the institution
his name. Half of this sum is appropriated to a college
building, and the other half is to endow a professorship
of belles lettres. The present buildings are situated upon
a broad plain, beneath a walnut grove, on the eastern skirt
of the village; and the library, apparatus, and professorships
are worthy to form the foundation of a <i>college</i>, as is
the ultimate design, albeit a Western college and a Northern
college are terms quite different in signification. I visited
this seminary, however, and was much pleased with its
faculty, buildings, and design. All is as it should be. What
reflecting mind does not hail with joy these temples of science
elevating themselves upon every green hill and broad plain
of the West, side by side with the sanctuaries of our holy
religion! It is intelligence, <i>baptized intelligence</i>, which alone
can save this beautiful valley, if indeed it is to be saved
from the inroads of arbitrary rule and false religion; which
is to hand down to another generation our civil and religious
immunities unimpaired. In most of the efforts for the
advancement of education in [183] the West, it is gratifying
to perceive that this principle has not been overlooked.
Nearly all those seminaries of learning which have been
established profess for their design the culture of the <i>moral</i>
powers as well as those of the <i>intellect</i>. That <i>intelligence</i> is
an essential requisite, a prime constituent of civil and re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ligious
freedom, all will admit; that it is the <i>only</i> requisite,
the <i>sole</i> constituent, may be questioned. "Knowledge," in
the celebrated language of Francis Bacon, "is power;" ay!
<span class="smcap">power</span>; an engine of tremendous, incalculable energy, but
blind in its operations. Applied to the cause of wisdom
and virtue, the richest of blessings; to that of infidelity and
vice, the greatest of curses. A lever to move the world,
its influence cannot be over-estimated; as the bulwark of
liberty and human happiness, its effect has been fearfully
miscalculated. Were man inclined as fully to good as to
evil, then might knowledge become the sovereign panacea
of every civil and moral ill; as man by nature unhappily <i>is</i>,
"the fruit of the tree" is oftener the stimulant to evil than
to good. Unfold the sacred record of the past. Why did
not intelligence save Greece? Greece! the land of intellect
and of thought; the birthspot of eloquence, philosophy, and
song! whose very populace were critics and bards! Greece,
in her early day of pastoral ignorance, was free; but from
the loftiest pinnacle of intellectual glory she fell; and science,
genius, intelligence, all could not save her. The buoyant
bark bounded beautifully over the blue-breasted billows;
but the helm, the helm of [184] <i>moral</i> culture was not there,
and her broad-spread pinions hurried her away only to a
speedier and more terrible destruction.</p>

<p>Ancient Rome: in the day of her rough simplicity, <i>she</i>
was free; but from her proudest point of <i>intellectual</i> development&mdash;the
era of Augustus&mdash;we date her decline.</p>

<p>France: who will aver that it was popular <i>ignorance</i> that
rolled over revolutionary France the ocean-wave of blood?
When have the French, <i>as a people</i>, exhibited a prouder era
of mind than that of their sixteenth Louis? The encyclopedists,
the most powerful men of the age, concentrated all their
vast energies to the diffusion of science among the people.
Then, as now, the press groaned in constant parturition;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and essays, magazines, tracts, treatises, libraries, were thrown
abroad as if by the arm of Omnipotent power. Then, as
now, the supremacy of human reason and of human society
flitted in "unreal mockery" before the intoxicated fancy;
and wildly was anticipated a career of upward and onward
advancement during the days of all coming time. France
was a nation of philosophers, and the great deep of mind
began to heave; the convulsed labouring went on, and, from
time to time, it burst out upon the surface. Then came
the tornado, and France, refined, intelligent, scientific, etherealized
France, was swept, as by Ruin's besom, of every
green thing. Her own children planted the dagger in her
bosom, and France was a nation of scientific, philosophic
parricides! But "France was poisoned [185] by infidelity."
Yes! so she was: but why was not the subtle element neutralized
in the cup of <i>knowledge</i> in which it was administered?
Is not "knowledge omnipotent to preserve; the salt to purify
the nations?"</p>

<p>England: view the experiment there. It is a matter of
parliamentary record, that within the last twenty years,
during the philanthropic efforts of Lord Henry Brougham
and his whig coadjutors, crime in England has more than
tripled. If knowledge, pure, defecated knowledge, be a
conservative principle, why do we witness these appalling
results?</p>

<p>What, then, shall be done? Shall the book of knowledge
be taken from the hands of the people, and again be
locked up in the libraries of the few? Shall the dusky
pall of ignorance and superstition again be flung around
the world, and a long starless midnight of a thousand
years once more come down to brood over mankind? By
no means. <i>Let</i> the sweet streams of knowledge go forth,
copious, free, to enrich and irrigate the garden of mind;
but mingle with them the pure waters of that "fount which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
flows fast by the oracles of God," or the effect now will be,
as it ever has been, only to intoxicate and madden the
human race. There is nothing in cold, dephlegmated intellect
to warm up and foster the energies of the moral system
of man. Intellect, mere intellect, can never tame the passions
or purify the heart.</p>

<p>Whoever will take upon himself the trouble to run
his eye over the "Tourist's Pocket Map of Illinois," will
perceive, stretching along the western border of the state,
parallel with the river, a broad carriage highway, in a direction
nearly north, to a little village called Carlinville; if then
he glances to the east, he may trace a narrow pathway striking
off at right angles to that section of the state. Well, it
is here, upon this pathway, just on the margin of a beautiful
prairie, sweeping away towards the town of Hillsborough,<a name="FNanchor_137_139" id="FNanchor_137_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_139" class="fnanchor">137</a>
that I find myself at the close of the day, after a long and
fatiguing ride. The afternoon has been one of those dreary,
drizzly, disagreeable seasons which relax the nerves and ride
like an incubus upon the spirits; and my route has conducted
me over a broad-spread, desolate plain; for, lovely as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
may appear the prairie when its bright flowerets and its tall
grass-tops [187] are nodding in the sunlight, it is a melancholy
place when the sky is beclouded and the rain is falling.
There is a certain indescribable sensation of loneliness,
which steals over the mind of the solitary traveller when he
finds himself alone in the heart of these boundless plains,
which he cannot away with; and the approach to a forest is
hailed with pleasure, as serving to quiet, with the vague
idea of <i>society</i>, this sense of dreariness and desertion. Especially
is this the case when rack and mist are hovering
along the border, veiling from the view those picturesque
woodland-points and promontories, and those green island-groves
which, when the sky is clear, swell out upon every
side into the bosom of the plain. Then all is fresh and
joyous to the eye as a vision: change the scene, and the
grand, gloomy, misty magnificence of old ocean presents
itself on every side. The relief to the picture afforded by
the discovery of man's habitation can hardly be described.</p>

<p>It was near nightfall, when, wearied by the fatigue of
riding and drenched with mist, I reached the log-cabin of
an old pioneer from Virginia, beneath whose lowly roof-tree
I am seated at this present writing; and though hardly the
most sumptuous edifice of which it has been my lot to be
an inmate, yet with no unenviable anticipations am I looking
forward to hearty refreshment and to sound slumber
upon the couch by my side. There are few objects to be
met with in the backwoods of the West more unique and
picturesque than the dwelling of the emigrant. After selecting
an elevated spot as [188] a site for building, a cabin
or a log-house&mdash;which is somewhat of an improvement
upon the first&mdash;is erected in the following manner. A
sufficient number of straight trees, of a size convenient for
removing, are felled, slightly hewn upon the opposite
sides, and the extremities notched or mortised with the axe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
They are then piled upon each other so that the extremities
lock together; and a single or double edifice is constructed,
agreeable to the taste or ability of the builder. Ordinarily
the cabin consists of two quadrangular apartments, separated
by a broad area between, connected by a common
floor, and covered by a common roof, presenting a parallelogram
triple the length of its width. The better of these
apartments is usually appropriated to the entertainment
of the casual guest, and is furnished with several beds and
some articles of rude furniture to correspond. The open
area constitutes the ordinary sitting and eating apartment
of the family in fine weather; and, from its coolness, affords
a delightful retreat. The intervals between the logs are
stuffed with fragments of wood or stone, and plastered with
mud or mortar, and the chimney is constructed much in
the same manner. The roof is covered with thin clapboards
of oak or ash, and, in lieu of nails, transverse pieces of timber
retain them in their places. Thousands of cabins are
thus constructed, without a particle of iron or even a common
plank. The rough clapboards give to the roof almost
the shaggy aspect of thatch at a little distance, but they
render it impermeable to even the heaviest and [189] most
protracted rain-storms. A rude gallery often extends along
one or both sides of the building, adding much to its coolness
in summer and to its warmth in winter by the protection
afforded from sun and snow. The floor is constructed
of short, thick planks, technically termed "puncheons,"
which are confined by wooden pins; and, though hardly
smooth enough for a ballroom, yet well answer every purpose
for a dwelling, and effectually resist moisture and cold.
The apertures are usually cut with a view to free ventilation,
and the chimneys stand at the extremities, outside the
walls of the cabin. A few pounds of nails, a few boxes of
glass, a few hundred feet of lumber, and a few days' assist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>ance
of a house-carpenter, would, of course, contribute not
a little to the comfort of the <i>shieling</i>; but neither of these
are indispensable. In rear of the premises rise the outbuildings;
stables, corn-crib, meat-house, &amp;c., all of them
quite as perfect in structure as the dwelling itself, and quite
as comfortable for residence. If to all this we add a well,
walled up with a section of a hollow cotton-wood, a cellar
or cave in the earth for a pantry, a zigzag rail fence
enclosing the whole clearing, a dozen acres of Indian corn
bristling up beyond, a small garden and orchard, and a
host of swine, cattle, poultry, and naked children about the
door, and the <i>tout ensemble</i> of a backwoods farmhouse is
complete. Minor circumstances vary, of course, with the
peculiarities of the country and the origin of the settlers;
but the principal features of the picture everywhere
prevail. The present mode of cultivation [190] sweeps off
vast quantities of timber; but it must soon be superseded.
Houses of brick and stone will take the place of log-cabins;
hedge-rows will supply that of rail enclosures, while coal
for fuel will be a substitute for wood.</p>

<p>At Upper Alton my visit was not a protracted one. In
a few hours, having gathered up my <i>fixens</i> and mounted
my <i>creetur</i>, I was threading a narrow pathway through the
forest. The trees, most of them lofty elms, in many
places for miles locked together their giant branches over
the road, forming a delightful screen from the sunbeams;
but it was found by no means the easiest imaginable task,
after once entering upon the direct route, to continue upon
it. This is a peculiarity of Western roads. The commencement
may be uniform enough, but the traveller soon
finds his path diverging all at once in several different
directions, like the radii of a circle, with no assignable
cause therefor, and not the slightest reason presenting
itself why he should select one of them in preference to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
half a dozen others, equally good or bad. And the sequel
often shows him that there in reality existed no more
cause of preference than was apparent; for, after a few
tortuosities through the forest, for variety's sake, the paths
all terminate in the same route. The obstacle of a tree, a
stump, a decaying log, or a sand-bank often splits the
path as if it were a flowing stream; and then the traveller
takes upon him to exercise the reserved right of radiating
to any point of the compass he [191] may think proper, provided
always that he succeeds in clearing the obstruction.</p>

<p>Passing many log-cabins, such as I have described, with
their extensive maize-fields, the rude dwelling of a sturdy
old emigrant from the far East sheltered me during the
heat of noon; and having luxuriated upon an excellent
dinner, prepared and served up in right New-England
fashion, I again betook myself to my solitary route. But I
little anticipated to have met, in the distant prairies of
Illinois, the habitation of one who had passed his life in
my own native state, almost in my own native village. Yet
I know not why the occurrence should be a cause of surprise.
Such emigrations are of constant occurrence. The farmer
had been a resident eight years in the West; his farm was
under that high cultivation characteristic of the Northern
emigrant, and peace and plenty seemed smiling around.
Yet was the emigrant satisfied? So far from it, he acknowledged
himself a disappointed man, and sighed for his
native northern home, with its bleak winds and barren
hillsides.</p>

<p>The region through which, for most of the day, I journeyed
was that, of very extensive application in the West,
styled "Barrens," by no means implying unproductiveness
of soil, but a species of surface of heterogeneous character,
uniting prairie with <i>timber</i> or forest, and usually a description
of land as fertile, healthy, and well-watered as may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
found. The misnomer is said to have derived its origin
from the early settlers of that section of Kentucky south
of Green River, which, presenting [192] only a scanty, dwarfish
growth of timber, was deemed of necessity <i>barren</i>, in the
true acceptation of the term.<a name="FNanchor_138_140" id="FNanchor_138_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_140" class="fnanchor">138</a> This soil there and elsewhere
is now considered better adapted to every variety of
produce and the vicissitudes of climate than even the deep
mould of the prairies and river-bottoms. The rapidity with
which a young forest springs forward, when the annual fires
have once been stopped in this species of land, is said to be
astonishing; and the first appearance of timber upon the
prairies gives it the character, to some extent, of barrens.
Beneath the trees is spread out a mossy turf, free from
thickets, but variegated by the gaudy petals of the heliotrope,
and the bright crimson buds of the dwarf-sumach
in the hollows. Indeed, some of the most lovely scenery of
the West is beheld in the landscapes of these barrens or
"oak openings," as they are more appropriately styled. For
miles the traveller wanders on, through a magnificence of
park scenery on every side, with all the diversity of the
slope, and swell, and meadow of human taste and skill.
Interminable avenues stretch away farther than the eye can
reach, while at intervals through the foliage flashes out the
unruffled surface of a pellucid lake. There are many of
these circular lakes or "sinkholes," as they are termed in
Western dialect, which, as they possess no inlet, seem supplied
by subterraneous springs or from the clouds. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
outline is that of an inverted cone, as if formed by the action
of whirling waters; and, as sinkholes exist in great numbers
in the vicinity of the rivers, and possess an outlet [193]
at the bottom through a substratum of porous limestone,
the idea is abundantly confirmed. In the State of Missouri
these peculiar springs are also observed. Some of them in
Greene county burst forth from the earth and the fissures
of the rocks with sufficient force to whirl a <i>run</i> of heavy
buhrstones, and the power of the fountains seems unaffected
by the vicissitudes of rain or drought. These same sinkholes,
circular ponds, and gushing springs are said to constitute
one of the most remarkable and interesting features
of the peninsula of Florida. There, as here, the substratum
is porous limestone; and it is the subsidence of the layers
which gives birth to the springs. The volume of water
thrown up by these boiling fountains is said to be astonishingly
great; many large ones, also, are known to exist in the
beds of lakes and rivers. From the circumstance of the
existence of these numerous springs originated, doubtless,
the tradition which Spanish chroniclers aver to have existed
among the Indians of Porto Rico and Cuba, that somewhere
among the Lucayo Islands or in the interior of Florida there
existed a fountain whose waters had the property of imparting
<i>rejuvenescence</i> and perpetuating perennial youth.
Only twenty years after the discoveries of Columbus, and
more than three centuries since, did the romantic Juan
Ponce de Leon, an associate of the Genoese and subsequent
governor of Porto Rico, explore the peninsula of Florida
in search of this traditionary fountain; of the success of
the enterprise we have no account. Among the other
poetic founts of the "Land of [194] Flowers," we are <i>told</i>
of one situated but a few miles from Fort Gaines, called
"Sappho's Fount,"<a name="FNanchor_139_141" id="FNanchor_139_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_141" class="fnanchor">139</a> from the idea which prevails that its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
waters impart the power of producing sweet sounds to the
voices of those who partake of them.</p>

<p>It was near evening, when, emerging from the shades of
the <i>barrens</i>, which, like everything else, however beautiful,
had, by continuous succession, begun to become somewhat
monotonous, my path issued rather unexpectedly upon the
margin of a wide, undulating prairie. I was struck, as is
every traveller at first view of these vast plains, with the
grandeur, and novelty, and loveliness of the scene before
me. For some moments I remained stationary, looking out
upon the boundless landscape before me. The tall grass-tops
waving in the billowy beauty in the breeze; the narrow
pathway winding off like a serpent over the rolling surface,
disappearing and reappearing till lost in the luxuriant herbage;
the shadowy, cloud-like aspect of the far-off trees,
looming up, here and there, in isolated masses along the
horizon, like the pyramidal canvass of ships at sea; the
deep-green groves besprinkled among the vegetation, like
islets in the waters; the crimson-died prairie-flower flashing
in the sun&mdash;these features of inanimate nature seemed
strangely beautiful to one born and bred amid the bold
mountain scenery of the North, and who now gazed upon
them "for the first."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The prairies! I behold them for the first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my heart swells, while the dilated sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Takes in the encircling vastness."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></div></div>

<p>[195] As I rode leisurely along upon the prairie's edge, I
passed many noble farms, with their log-cabins couched in
a corner beneath the forest; and, verily, would a farmer of
Yankee-land "stare and gasp" to behold the prairie cornfield
of the Western emigrant; and yet more would he be
amazed to witness the rank, rustling luxuriance of the vegetable
itself. Descending a swell of the prairie near one of
these farms, a buck with his doe leaped out from a thicket
beside my path, and away, away bounded the "happy pair"
over the grass-tops, free as the wind. They are often shot
upon the prairies, I was informed by an old hunter, at whose
cabin, in the middle of the plain, I drew up at twilight, and
with whom I passed the night. He was a pioneer from
<i>the dark and bloody ground</i>, and many a time had followed
the wild buck through those aged forests, where Boone, and
Whitley, and Kenton once roved.<a name="FNanchor_140_142" id="FNanchor_140_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_142" class="fnanchor">140</a> Only fifty years ago,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and for the first time were the beautiful fields of Kentucky
turned up by the ploughshare of the Virginia emigrant; yet
their very descendants of the first generation we behold
plunging deeper into the wilderness West. How would the
worthy old Governor Spotswood stand astounded, could he
now rear his venerable bones from their long resting-place,
and look forth upon this lovely land, far away beyond the
Blue Ridge of the Alleghany hills, the very passage of which
he had deemed not unworthy "the horseshoe of gold" and
"the order tramontane." "<i>Sic juvat transcendere montes.</i>"
Twenty years before Daniel Boone, "backwoodsman of
Kentucky," was [196] born, Alexander Spotswood, governor
of Virginia, undertook, with great preparation, a passage
of the Alleghany ridge. For this expedition were provided
a large number of horseshoes, an article not common in
some sections of the "Old Dominion;" and from this circumstance,
upon their return, though without a glimpse of
the Western Valley, was instituted the "<i>Tramontane Order</i>,
or <i>Knights of the Golden Horseshoe</i>," with the motto above.
The badge of distinction for having made a passage of the
Blue Ridge was a golden horseshoe worn upon the breast.
Could the young man of that day have protracted the limits
of life but a few years beyond his threescore and ten, what
astonishment would not have filled him to behold <i>now</i>, as
"the broad, the bright, the glorious West," the region <i>then</i>
regarded as the unknown and howling <i>wilderness beyond
the mountains</i>! Yet even thus it is.<a name="FNanchor_141_143" id="FNanchor_141_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_143" class="fnanchor">141</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>A long ride over a dusty road, beneath a sultry sun, made
me not unwilling to retire to an early rest. But in a few
hours my slumbers were broken in upon by the glare of
lightning and the crash of thunder. For nearly five weeks
had the prairies been refreshed by not a solitary shower;
and the withered crops and the parched soil, baked to the
consistency of stone or ground up to powder, betrayed alarming
evidence of the consequence. Day had succeeded day.
The scorching sun had gone up in the firmament, blazed
from his meridian throne, and in lurid sultriness descended
to his rest. The subtle fluid had been gathering and concentrating
in the skies; and, early on the night of [197]
which I speak, an inky cloud had been perceived rolling
slowly up from the western horizon, until the whole heavens
were enveloped in blackness. Then the tempest burst forth.
Peal upon peal the hoarse thunder came booming over the
prairies; and the red lightning would glare, and stream,
and almost hiss along the midnight sky, like Ossian's storm-spirit
riding on the blast. At length there was a hush of
elements, and all was still&mdash;"still as the spirit's silence;"
then came one prolonged, deafening, terrible crash and
rattle, as if the concave of the firmament had been rent
asunder, and the splintered fragments, hurled abroad,
were flying through the boundlessness of space; the next
moment, and the torrents came weltering through the
darkness. I have witnessed thunder-storms on the deep,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and many a one among the cliffs of my native hills; but
a midnight thunder-gust upon the broad prairie-plains of
the West is more terrible than they. A more sublimely
magnificent spectacle have I never beheld than that, when
one of these broad-sheeted masses of purple light would
blaze along the black bosom of the cloud, quiver for an
instant over the prairie miles in extent, flinging around the
scene a garment of flame, and then go out in darkness.</p>

</div></div>

<p>[198] And a sharer in the tempest surely was "a certain
weary pilgrim, in an upper chamber" of a certain log-cabin
of the prairie. Unhappily for his repose or quiet, had he
desired either, the worthy host, in laudable zeal for a window
when erecting his hut, had thought proper to neglect or to
forget one of the indispensables for such a convenience in
shape of sundry panes of glass. Wherefore, as is easy to
perceive, said aperture commanding the right flank of the
pilgrim's dormitory, the warring elements without found
abundant entrance for a by-skirmish within. Sad to relate,
the pilgrim was routed, "horse, foot, and dragoons;"
whereupon, agreeable to Falstaff's <i>discretionary</i> views of
valour, seizing upon personal effects, he beat a retreat to
more hospitable realms.</p>

<p>It was morning. The storm had passed away, and the
early sunlight was streaming gloriously over the fresh
landscape. The atmosphere, discharged of its electric
burden, was playing cool and free among the grass-tops;
the lark was carolling in the clouds above its grassy nest;
the deer was rising from his sprinkled lair, and the morning
mists were rolling heavily in masses along the skirts
of the prairie woodlands, as I mounted my horse at the
door of the cabin beneath whose roof I had passed the
night. Before me at no great distance, upon the edge of
the plain, rose an open park of lofty oaks, with a mossy
turf beneath; and the whole scene, lighted up by the
sunbeams breaking through the ragged mists, presented a
most gorgeous spectacle. The entire wilderness of green;
every bough, spray, leaf; every blade of grass, wild weed,
and floweret, was hung with trembling [200] drops of
liquid light, which, reflecting and refracting the sun-rays,
threw back all the hues of the iris. It was indeed a
morning of beauty after the tempest; and Nature seemed
to have arrayed herself in her bridal robes, glittering in all
their own matchless jewellery to greet its coming.</p>

<p>Constituted as we all naturally are, there exist, bound
up within the secresies of the bosom, certain emotions and
sentiments, designed by our Creator to leap forth in joyous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>ness
in view of the magnificence of his works; certain
springs of exquisite delicacy deep hidden in the chambers
of the breast, but which, touched or breathed upon never
so lightly, strike the keys of feeling and fill the heart with
harmony. And I envy not the feelings of that man who,
amid all "the glories of this visible world," can stand a
passionless beholder; who feels not his pulses thrill with
quickened vibration, and his heart to heave in fuller gush
as he views the beneficence of his Maker in the magnificence
of his works; who from all can turn calmly away,
and in the chill, withering accents of Atheism, pronounce
it the offspring of blind fatality, the resultant of meaningless
chance!</p>

<p>When we look abroad upon the panorama of creation,
so palpable is the impress of an omnipotent hand, and so
deeply upon all its features is planted the demonstration
of design, that it would almost seem, in the absence of
reason and revelation, we need but contemplate the
scenery of nature to be satisfied of the existence of an
all-wise, all-powerful Being, whose workmanship it is.
The [201] firmament, with its marshalled and glittering
hosts; the earth, spread out in boundlessness at our feet,
now draperied in the verdant freshness of springtime,
anon in the magnificent glories of summer sultriness, again
teeming with the mellow beauty of autumnal harvesting,
and then slumbering in the chill, cheerless desolation
of winter, all proclaim a Deity eternal in existence,
boundless in might. The mountain that rears its bald forehead
to the clouds; the booming cataract; the unfathomed,
mysterious sounding ocean; the magnificent sweep of
the Western prairie; the eternal flow of the Western
river, proclaim, in tones extensive as the universe&mdash;tones
not to be misunderstood, that their <span class="smcap">Creator</span> lives.</p>

<p>It is a circumstance in the character of the human mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
which not the most careless or casual observer of its operations
can fail to have remarked, that the contemplation
of all grand and immeasurable objects has a tendency to
enlarge and elevate the understanding, lend a loftier tone
to the feelings, and, agreeable to the moral constitution of
man, carry up his thoughts and his emotions directly to
their Author, "from Nature up to Nature's God." The
savage son of the wilderness, as he roams through his
grand and gloomy forests, which for centuries have veiled
the soil at their base from the sunlight, perceives a solemn
awe stealing over him as he listens to the surges of the
winds rolling among the heavy branches; and in Nature's
simplicity, untaught but by her untutored promptings,
he believes that "the Great Spirit is whispering in [202]
the tree tops." He stands by the side of Niagara. With
subdued emotions he gazes upon the majestic world of
floods as they hurry on. They reach the barrier! they
leap its precipice! they are lost in thunder and in foam!
And, as the raging waters disappear in the black abyss; as
the bow of the covenant, "like hope upon a deathbed,"
flings its irised arch in horrible beauty athwart the hell
of elements, the bewildered child of nature feels his soul
swell within his bosom; the thought rises solemnly upon
him, "the Great Spirit is here;" and with timid solicitude
he peers through the forest shades around him for some
palpable demonstration of His presence. And such is the
effect of all the grand scenes of nature upon the mind of
the savage: they lead it up to the "Great Spirit." Upon
this principle is the fact alone to be accounted for, that
no race of beings has yet been discovered destitute of <i>all</i>
idea of a Supreme Intelligence to whom is due homage
and obedience. It is <i>His</i> voice they hear in the deep
hour of midnight, when the red lightning quivers along
the bosom of the cloud, and the thunder-peal rattles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
through the firmament. It is <i>He</i> they recognise in the
bright orb of day, as he blazes from the eastern horizon;
or, "like a monarch on a funeral pile," sinks to his rest.
<i>He</i> is beheld in the pale queen of night, as in silvery
radiance she walks the firmament, and in the beautiful
star of evening as it sinks behind his native hills. In the
soft breathing of the "summer wind" and in the terrible
sublimity of the autumn tempest; in the gentle dew of
heaven and [203] the summer torrent; in the sparkling rivulet
and the wide, wild river; in the delicate prairie-flower
and the gnarled monarch of the hills; in the glittering minnow
and the massive narwhal; in the fairy humbird and
the sweeping eagle; in each and in all of the creations of
universal nature, the mind of the savage sees, feels, <i>realizes</i>
the presence of a Deity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Earth with her thousand voices praises God!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">is the beautiful sentiment of Coleridge's hymn in the Vale
of Chamouni; and its truth will be doubted by no man of
refined sensibility or cultivated taste. In viewing the grand
scenery of nature, the mind of the savage and the poet alike
perceive the features of Deity; on the bright page of creation,
in characters enstamped by his own mighty hand, they
read his perfections and his attributes; the vast volume is
spread out to every eye; he who will may read and be wise.
And yet, delightful and instructive as the study of Nature's
creations cannot fail to be, it is a strange thing that, by
many, so little regard is betrayed for them. How often do
we gaze upon the orb of day, as he goes down the western
heavens in glory to his rest; how often do we look away to
the far-off star, as it pursues in beauty its lonely pathway,
distinct amid the myriads that surround it; how often do
we glance abroad upon the splendours of earth, and then,
from all this demonstration of Omnipotent goodness turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
away with not <i>one</i> pulsation of gratitude to the Creator of
suns and stars; with not one aspiration of feeling, one
acknowledgment of regard to [204] the Lord of the universe?
Yet surely, whatever repinings may at times
imbitter the unsanctified bosom in view of the moral,
the intellectual, or social arrangements of existence, there
should arise but one emotion, and that&mdash;<i>praise</i> in view of
<i>inanimate</i> nature. Here is naught but power and goodness;
now, as at the dawn of Creation's morning, "all is
very good." But these are scenes upon which the eye has
turned from earliest infancy; and to this cause alone may
we attribute the fact, that though their grandeur may never
weary or their glories pall upon the sense, yet our gaze upon
them is often that of coldness and indifferent regard.
Still their influence upon us, though inappreciable, is sure.
If we look abroad upon the race of man, we cannot but
admit the conviction that natural scenery, hardly less
than climate, government, or religion, lays its impress
upon human character. It is where Nature exhibits herself
in her loftiest moods that her influence on man is
most observable. 'Tis there we find the human mind
most chainlessly free, and the attachments of patriotic
feeling most tenacious and exalted. To what influence
more than to that of the gigantic features of nature
around him, amid which he first opened his eyes to the
light, and with which from boyhood days he has been
conversant, are we to attribute that indomitable hate
to oppression, that enthusiastic passion for liberty, and
that wild idolatry of country which characterizes the Swiss
mountaineer? <i>He</i> would be free as the geyer-eagle of his
native cliffs, whose eyrie hangs in the clouds, whose eye
brightens in [205] the sunlight, whose wild shriek rises on
the tempest, and whose fierce brood is nurtured amid crags
untrodden by the footstep of man. To <i>his</i> ear the sweep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of the terrible <i>lauwine</i>, the dash of the mountain cataract,
the sullen roar of the mountain forest, is a music for which,
in a foreign land, he pines away and dies. And all these
scenes have but one language&mdash;and that is chainless
<i>independence</i>!</p>

<p>It is a fact well established, and one to be accounted for
upon no principle other than that which we advance, that
the dwellers in mountainous regions, and those whose
homes are amid the grandeur of nature, are found to be
more attached to the spot of their nativity than are other
races of men, and that they are ever more forward to
defend their ice-clad precipices from the attack of the
invader. For centuries have the Swiss inhabited the
mountains of the Alps. They inhabit them still, and
have never been entirely subdued. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The free Switzer yet bestrides <i>alone</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chainless mountains."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of what <i>other</i> nation of Europe, if we except the Highlands
of Scotland, may anything like the same assertion
with truth be made? We are told that the mountains of
Caucasus and Himmalaya, in Asia, still retain the race of
people which from time immemorial have possessed them.
The same accents echo along their "tuneful cliffs" as centuries
since were listened to by the patriarchs; while at
their base, chance, and change, and conquest, like successive
floods, have swept the delta-plains of [206] the Ganges
and Euphrates. These are but isolated instances from a
multitude of similar character, which might be advanced
in support of the position we have assumed. Nor is it
strange that peculiarities like these should be witnessed.
There must ever be <i>something</i> to love, if the emotion is to
be permanently called forth; it matters little whether it be
in the features of inanimate nature or in those of man; and,
alike in both cases, do the boldest and most prominent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
create the deepest impression. Just so it is with our admiration
of character; there must exist bold and distinctive
traits, good or bad, to arouse for it unusual regard.
A monotony of character or of feeling is as wearisome
as a monotony of sound or scenery.</p>

<p>But to return from a digression which has become unconscionably
long. After a brisk gallop of a few hours
through the delightful scenery of the Barrens, I found myself
approaching the little town of Carlinville. As I drew
nigh to the village, I found it absolutely reeling under the
excitement of the "Grand Menagerie." From all points
of the compass, men, women, and children, emerging from
the forest, came pouring into the place, some upon horses,
some in farm-wagons, and troops of others on foot,
slipping and sliding along in a fashion most distressing to
behold. The soil in this vicinity is a black loam of surpassing
fertility; and, when saturated with moisture, it adheres
to the sole with most pertinacious tenacity, more
like to an amalgam of soot and soap-grease than to any
other substance that has ever come under my cognizance.
The inn [207] was thronged by neighbouring farmers, some
canvassing the relative and individual merits of the <i>Zebedee</i>
and the <i>Portimous</i>; others sagely dwelling upon the
mooted point of peril to be apprehended from the great
<i>sarpent</i>&mdash;<i>Boy Contractor</i>; while little unwashen wights did
run about and dangerously prophecy on the recent disappearance
of the big elephant.</p>

<p>Carlinville is a considerable village, situated on the margin
of a pleasant prairie, on the north side of Macoupin
Creek, and is the seat of justice for the county. The name
<i>Macoupin</i> is said to be of aboriginal derivation, and by the
early French chroniclers was spelled and pronounced <i>Ma-qua-pin</i>,
until its present uncomely combination of letters
became legalized on the statute-book. The term, we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
told by Charlevoix, the French <i>voyageur</i>, is the Indian name
of an esculent with a broad corolla, found in many of the
ponds and creeks of Illinois, especially along the course of
the romantic stream bearing its name. The larger roots,
eaten raw, were poisonous, and the natives were accustomed
to dig ovens in the earth, into which, being walled up with
flat stones and heated, was deposited the vegetable. After
remaining for forty-eight hours in this situation, the deleterious
qualities were found extracted, and the root being
dried, was esteemed a luxury by the Indians. The region
bordering upon Carlinville is amazingly fertile, and proportionally
divided into prairie and timber&mdash;a circumstance
by no means unworthy of notice. There has been a design
of establishing [208] here a Theological Seminary, but
the question of its site has been a point easier to discuss
than to decide.<a name="FNanchor_142_144" id="FNanchor_142_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_144" class="fnanchor">142</a> My tarry at the village was a brief one,
though I became acquainted with a number of its worthy
citizens; and in the log-office of a young limb of <i>legality</i>,
obtained, as a special distinction, a glance at a forthcoming
"Fourth-of-July" oration, fruitful in those sonorous
periods and stereotyped patriotics indispensable on such
occasions, and, at all hazard, made and provided for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
As I was leaving the village I was met by multitudes, pouring
in from all sections of the surrounding region, literally
thronging the ways; mothers on horseback, with young children
in their arms; fathers with daughters and wives <i>en
croupe</i>, and at intervals an individual, in quiet possession
of an entire animal, came sliding along in the mud, in
fashion marvellously entertaining to witness. A huge
cart there likewise was, which excited no small degree of
admiration as it rolled on, swarmed with women and
children. An aged patriarch, with hoary locks resting
upon his shoulders, enacted the part of charioteer to
this primitive establishment; and now, in zealous impatience
to reach the scene of action, from which the
braying horns came resounding loud and clear through
the forest, he was wretchedly belabouring, by means of an
endless whip, six unhappy oxen to augment their speed.</p>

<p>I had travelled not many miles when a black cloud
spread itself rapidly over the sky, and in a few moments
the thunder began to bellow, the lightnings to flash, and
the rain to fall in torrents. [209] Luckily enough for me,
I found myself in the neighbourhood of man's habitation.
Leaping hastily from my steed, and lending him an impetus
with my riding whip which carried him safely beneath a
hospitable shed which stood thereby, I betook myself,
without ceremony or delay, to the mansion house itself,
glad enough to find its roof above me as the first big raindrops
came splashing to the ground. The little edifice was
tenanted by three females and divers flaxen-pated, sun-bleached
urchins of all ages and sizes, and, at the moment
of my entrance, all in high dudgeon, because, forsooth, they
were not to be permitted to drench themselves in the
anticipated shower. Like Noah's dove, they were accordingly
pulled within the ark, and thereupon thought proper
to set up their several and collective <i>Ebenezers</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well!" was my exclamation, in true Yankee fashion,
as I bowed my head low in entering the humble postern;
"we're going to get pretty considerable of a sprinkling, I
guess." "I reckon," was the sententious response of the
most motherly-seeming of the three women, at the same
time vociferating to the three larger of the children, "Oh,
there, you Bill, Sall, Polly, honeys, get the gentleman a
cheer! Walk in, sir; set down and take a seat!" This
evolution of "setting down and taking a seat" was at length
successfully effected, after sundry man&#339;uvrings by way of
planting the three pedestals of the uncouth tripod upon
the same plane, and avoiding the fearful yawnings in the
<i>puncheon</i> floor. When all was at length quiet, I [210] improved
the opportunity of gazing about me to explore the
curious habitation into which I found myself inserted.</p>

<p>The structure, about twenty feet square, had originally
been constructed of rough logs, the interstices stuffed with
fragments of wood and stone, and daubed with clay; the
chimney was built up of sticks laid crosswise, and plastered
with the same material to resist the fire. Such had been
the backwoodsman's cabin in its primitive prime; but time
and the elements had been busy with the little edifice, and
sadly had it suffered. Window or casement was there none,
neither was there need thereof; for the hingeless door stood
ever open, the clay was disappearing from the intervals between
the logs, and the huge fireplace of stone exhibited
yawning apertures, abundantly sufficient for all the purposes
of light and ventilation to the single apartment of
the building. The <i>puncheon</i> floor I have alluded to, and
it corresponded well with the roof of the cabin, which had
never, in its best estate, been designed to resist the peltings
of such a pitiless torrent as was now assailing it. The water
soon began trickling in little rivulets upon my shoulders,
and my only alternative was my umbrella for shelter. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
furniture of the apartment consisted of two plank-erections
designed for bedsteads, which, with a tall clothes-press,
divers rude boxes, and a side-saddle, occupied a better
moiety of the area; while a rough table, a shelf against the
wall, upon which stood a water-pail, a gourd, and a few
broken trenchers, completed the household paraphernalia
[211] of this most unique of habitations. A half-consumed
flitch of bacon suspended in the chimney, and a huge iron
pot upon the fire, from which issued a savoury indication of
the seething mess within, completes the "still-life" of the
picture. Upon one of the beds reclined one of the females
to avoid the rain; a second was alternating her attentions
between her infant and her needle; while the third, a buxom
young baggage, who, by-the-by, was on a visit to her sister,
was busying herself in the culinary occupations of the household,
much the chief portion of which consisted in watching
the huge dinner-pot aforesaid, with its savoury contents.</p>

<p>After remaining nearly two hours in the cabin, in hopes
that the storm would abate, I concluded that, since my
umbrella was no sinecure <i>within</i> doors, it might as well be
put in requisition <i>without</i>, and mounted my steed, though
the rain was yet falling. I had proceeded but a few miles
upon the muddy pathway when my compass informed me
that I had varied from my route, a circumstance by no
means uncommon on the Western prairies. During the
whole afternoon, therefore, I continued upon my way across
a broad pathless prairie, some twelve or eighteen miles in
extent, and dreary enough withal, until nightfall, when I
rejoiced to find myself the inmate of the comfortable farmhouse
upon its edge from which my last was dated.</p>

<p>More than three centuries ago, when the romantic Ponce
de Leon, with his chivalrous followers, first planted foot
upon the southern extremity of the great Western Valley,
the discovery of the far-famed "Fountain of Youth" was
the wild vision which lured him on. Though disappointed
in the object of his enterprise, the adventurous Spaniard
was enraptured with the loveliness of a land which even
the golden realms of "Old Castile" had never realized; and
<i>Florida</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143_145" id="FNanchor_143_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_145" class="fnanchor">143</a> "the Land of Flowers," was the poetic name it
inspired. Twenty years, and the bold soldier Ferdinand
de Soto, of Cuba, [213] the associate of Pizarro, with a thousand
steel-clad warriors at his back, penetrated the valley
to the far-distant post of Arkansas, and "<i>El padre de las
aguas</i>" was the expressive name of the mighty stream he discovered,
beneath the eternal flow of whose surges he laid his
bones to their rest.<a name="FNanchor_144_146" id="FNanchor_144_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_146" class="fnanchor">144</a> "<i>La Belle Rivi&egrave;re!</i>" was the delighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
exclamation which burst from the lips of the Canadian voyageur,
as, with wonder hourly increasing, he glided in his
light pirogue between the swelling bluffs, and wound among
the thousand isles of the beautiful Ohio. The heroic Norman,
Sieur La Salle, when for the first time he beheld the
pleasant hunting-grounds of the peaceful Illini, pronounced
them a "Terrestrial Paradise." Daniel Boone, the bold
pioneer of the West, fifty years ago, when standing on the
last blue line of the Alleghanies, and at the close of a day
of weary journeying, he looked down upon the beautiful
fields of "Old Kentucke," now gilded by the evening sun,
turned his back for ever upon the green banks of the
Yadkin and the soil of his nativity, hailing the glories of a
new-found home.<a name="FNanchor_145_148" id="FNanchor_145_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_148" class="fnanchor">145</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus has it ever been; and even yet the "pilgrim

<p>[214] It was a fine Sabbath morning when I mounted
my steed at the gate of the log farmhouse where I had
passed the night, to pursue my journey over the prairie,
upon the verge of which it stood. The village of Hillsborough
was but a few miles distant, and there I had
resolved to observe the sacredness of the day. The showers
of the preceding evening had refreshed the atmosphere,
which danced over the plain in exhilarating gales, and
rustled among the boughs of the green woodlands I was
leaving. Before me was spread out a waving, undulating
landscape, with herds of cattle sprinkled here and there
in isolated masses over the surface; the rabbit and wild-fowl
were sporting along the pathway, and the bright
woodpecker, with his splendid plumage and querulous note,
was flitting to and fro among the thickets. Far away along
the eastern horizon stretched the dark line of forest. The
gorgeous prairie-flower flung out its crimson petals upon
the breeze, "blushing like a banner bathed in slaughter,"
and methought it snapped more gayly in the morning sunbeams
than it was wont; the long grass rustled musically
its wavy masses back and forth, and, amid the Sabbath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
stillness around, methought there were there notes of sweetness
not before observed. The whole scene lay calm and
quiet, as if Nature, if not man, recognised the Divine
injunction <i>to rest</i>; and the idea suggested itself, that a
solitary Sabbath on the wild prairie, in silent converse
with the Almighty, might not be all unprofitable. [215]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>From the centre of the prairie the landscape rolled gracefully
away towards the eastern timber, studded along its
edge with farms. The retrospect from beneath the tall
oaks of the prairie over which I had passed was exceedingly
fine; the idea strikes the spectator at once, and with much
force, that the whole plain was once a sheet of water.
Indeed, were we to form our opinion from the <i>appearance</i>
of many of the prairies of Illinois, the idea would be irresistible,
that this peculiar species of surface originated in
a submersion of the whole state. There are many circumstances
which lead us to the conclusion that these vast
meadows once formed the bed of a body of water similar
to the Northern lakes; and when the lowest point at the
<i>Grand Tower</i> on the Mississippi was torn away by some
convulsion of nature, a uniform surface of fine rich mud
was left. The ravines were ploughed in the soft soil by
subsequent floods, and hence, while the elevated lands are
fertile, those more depressed are far less so. The soil of
the prairies is of a character decidedly alluvial, being composed
of compact strata of loam piled upon each other,
like that at the bottom of bodies of water long stagnant.
The first stratum is a black, pliable mould, from two feet
to five in depth; the second a red clay, amalgamated with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
sand, from [216] five to ten feet in thickness; the third
a blue clay, mixed with pebbles, of beautiful appearance,
unctuous to the feeling, and, when exposed to the atmosphere,
of a fetid smell. Lakes are often found in the prairies
abounding in fish, which, when the waters subside, are
removed by cartloads. The origin of these vast prairie-plains
is, after all, no easy matter to decide; but, whatever
the cause, they have doubtless been perpetuated by the
autumnal fires which, year after year, from an era which
the earliest chronicles of history or tradition have failed
to record, have swept their surface; for, as soon as the
grass is destroyed by the plough, the winged seeds of the
cotton-wood and sycamore take root, and a young growth
of timber sprouts forth. The same is true along the
margin of creeks and streams, or upon steril or wet prairies,
where the vegetation does not become sufficiently
heavy or combustible for conflagration to a great extent.
These fires originated either in the friction of the sear
and tinder-like underbrush, agitated by the high winds,
or they were kindled by the Indians for the purpose of
dislodging game. The mode of hunting by circular fires
is said to have prevailed at the time when Captain Smith
first visited the shores of Chesapeake Bay, where extensive
prairies then existed. These plains, by cultivation, have
long since disappeared. Mungo Park describes the annual
fires upon the plains of Western Africa for a similar
purpose and with the same result.<a name="FNanchor_147_150" id="FNanchor_147_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_150" class="fnanchor">147</a> Tracts of considerable

<p>"Coot morning, shur! A pleashant tay, shur! Coome
in, shur!" was the hospitable greeting of mine host, or
rather of the major domo of the little brick hostelrie of
Hillsborough as I drove up to the bar-room entrance. He
was a comical-looking, bottle-shaped little personage, with
a jolly red nose, all the brighter, doubtless, for certain
goodly potations of his own goodly admixtures; with a
brief brace of legs, inserted into a pair of inexpressibles
<i>&agrave; la Turque</i>, a world too big, and a white capote a world
too little, to complete the Sunday toilet. He could boast,
moreover, that amazing lubricity of speech, and that oiliness
of tongue wherewith sinful publicans have ever been
prone to beguile unwary wayfarers, <i>taking in travellers</i>,
forsooth! Before I was fully aware of the change in my
circumstances, I found myself quietly dispossessed of horse
and equipments, and placing my foot across the threshold.
The fleshy little Dutchman, though now secure in his capture,
proceeded to redouble his assiduities.</p>

<p>"Anything to trink, shur? Plack your poots, shur?
shave your face, shur?" and a host of farther interrogatories,
which I at length contrived to cut short with, "Show
me a chamber, sir!"</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Church, at which I attended worship,
is a neat little edifice of brick, in modern style, but not
completed. The walls remained unconscious of plaster;
the orchestra, a naked scaffolding; the pulpit, a box of
rough boards; and, [218] more <i>picturesque</i> than all, in lieu
of pews, slips, or any such thing, a few coarse slabs of all
forms and fashions, supported on remnants of timber and
plank, occupied the open area for seats. And marvellously
comfortless are such seats, to my certain experience. In
the evening I attended the "Luteran Church," as my major
domo styled it, at the special instance of one of its worthy
members. This house of worship is designed for a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
one&mdash;the largest in the state, I was informed&mdash;but, like
its neighbour, was as yet but commenced. The external
walls were quite complete; but the rafters, beams, studs,
and braces within presented a mere skeleton, while a few
loose boards, which sprang and creaked beneath the foot,
were spread over the sleepers as an apology for a floor.
There's practical utility for an economist! Because a
church is unfinished is no good and sufficient reason why
it should remain unoccupied!</p>

<p>As we entered the building, my <i>cicerone</i> very unexpectedly
favoured me with an introduction to the minister. He
was a dark, solemn-looking man, with a huge Bible and
psalm-book choicely tucked under his left arm. After
sundry glances at my dress and demeanour, and other
sundry whisperings in the ear of my companion, the good
man drew nigh, and delivered himself of the interrogatory,
"Are you a clergyman, sir?" At this sage inquiry, so
sagely administered, my rebellious lips struggled with a
smile, which, I misdoubt me much, was not unobserved
by the dark-looking minister; [219] for, upon my reply
in the negative, he turned very unceremoniously away, and
betook him to his pulpit. By-the-by, this had by no
means been the first time I had been called to answer
the same inquiry during my ramble in the West.</p>

<p>On returning to our lodgings after service, we found quite
a respectable congregation gathered around the signpost,
to whom my pink of major domos was holding forth in no
measured terms upon the propriety of "letting off the pig
guns" at the dawning of the ever-memorable morrow,<a name="FNanchor_148_151" id="FNanchor_148_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_151" class="fnanchor">148</a>
"in honour of the tay when our old farders fought like
coot fellows; they tid so, py jingoes; and I'll pe out at
tree o'glock, py jingoes, I will so," raphsodied the little
Dutchman, warming up under the fervour of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
eloquence. This subject was still the theme of his rejoicing
when he marshalled me to my dormitory and
wished me "pleashant treams."</p>

<p>The first faint streak of crimson along the eastern heavens
beheld me mounting at the door of the inn; and by my side
was the patriotic domo, bowing, and ducking, and telling
over all manner of kind wishes till I had evanished from
view. A more precious relic of the true oldfashioned,
swaggering, pot-bellied publican is rarely to be met, than
that which I encountered in the person of the odd little
genius whose peculiarities I have recounted: even the
worthy old "Caleb of Ravenswood," that miracle of major
domos, would not [220] have disowned my <i>Dutchy</i> for a
brother craftsman. The village of Hillsborough is a pleasant,
healthy, thriving place; and being intersected by some of
the most important state routes, will always remain a thoroughfare.
An attempt has been made by one of its citizens
to obtain for this place the location of the Theological Seminary
now in contemplation in the vicinity rather than at
Carlinville, and the offer he has made is a truly munificent
one. The site proposed is a beautiful mound, rising on
the prairie's edge south of the village, commanding a view
for miles in every direction, and is far more eligible than
any spot I ever observed in Carlinville.</p>

<p>After crossing a prairie about a dozen miles in width,
and taking breakfast with a farmer upon its edge, I continued
my journey over the undulating plains until near
the middle of the afternoon, when I reached my present
stage. The whole region, as I journeyed through it, lay
still and quiet: every farmhouse and log-cabin was deserted
by its tenants, who had congregated to the nearest villages
to celebrate the day; and, verily, not a little did my heart
smite me at my own heedless desecration of the political
Sabbath of our land.</p>

<p>Ever since the days of that king of vagabonds, the mighty
Nimrod of sacred story, and, for aught to the contrary,
as long before, there has existed a certain roving, tameless
race of wights, whose chief delight has consisted in wandering
up and down upon the face of the earth, with no definite
object of pursuit, and with no motive of peregrination
save a kind of restless, unsatisfied craving after change;
in its results much like the migratory instinct of passage-birds,
but, unlike that periodical instinct, incessant in
exercise. Now, whether it so be that a tincture of this
same vagrant, Bohemian spirit is coursing my veins under
the name of "Yankee enterprise," or whether, in my
wanderings through these wild, unsettled regions, I have
imbibed a portion thereof, is not for me to decide. Nevertheless,
sure it is, not unfrequently are its promptings
detected as I journey through this beautiful land.</p>

<p>It is evening now, and, after the fatigues of a pleasant
day's ride, I am seated beneath the piazza [222] of a neat
farmhouse in the edge of a forest, through which, for the
last hour, my path has conducted, and looking out upon a
broad landscape of prairie. My landlord, a high-minded,
haughty Virginia emigrant, bitterly complains because, forsooth,
in the absence of slave-labour, he is forced to cultivate
his own farm; and though, by the aid of a Dutchman,
he has made a pretty place of it, yet he vows by all he loves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
to lay his bones within the boundaries of the "Ancient
Dominion." My ride since noon has been delightful; over
broad plains, intersected by deep creeks, with their densely-wooded
bottoms. These streams constitute one of the
most romantic features of the country. I have crossed
very many during my tour, and all exhibit the same characteristics:
a broad, deep-cut channel, with precipitous banks
loaded with enormous trees, their trunks interwoven and
matted with tangled underbrush and gigantic vegetation.
As the traveller stands upon the arch of the bridge of logs
thrown over these creeks, sometimes with an altitude at
the centre of forty feet, he looks down upon a stream flowing
in a deep, serpentine bed, and winding away into the
dusky shades of the overhanging woods, until a graceful
bend withdraws the dark surface of the waters from his
view. In the dry months of summer, these creeks and
ravines are either completely free of water, or contain but
a mere rivulet; and the traveller is amazed at the depth
and breadth of a channel so scantily supplied. But at the
season of the spring or autumnal rains the scene is changed:
a deep, turbid torrent rolls [223] wildly onward through
the dark woods, bearing on its surface the trunks of trees
and the ruins of bridges swept from its banks; and the
stream which, a few weeks before, would scarcely have wet
the traveller's sole, is now an obstacle in his route difficult
and dangerous to overcome.</p>

<p>Within a few miles of my present quarters an adventure
transpired of some slight interest to <i>myself</i>, at least, as it
afforded me a weary trudge beneath a broiling sun. As
I was leisurely pursuing my way through the forest, I had
chanced to spy upon the banks of the roadside a cluster
of wild flowers of hues unusually brilliant; and, with a
spirit worthy of Dr. Bat,<a name="FNanchor_149_152" id="FNanchor_149_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_152" class="fnanchor">149</a> I at once resolved they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
enrich my "<i>hortus siccus</i>." Alighting, therefore, and leaving
my steed by the roadside, I at length succeeded, after
most laudable scramblings for the advancement of science,
in gathering up a bouquet of surpassing magnificence. Alas!
alas! would it had been less so; for my youthful steed, all
unused to such sights and actions, and possessing, moreover,
a most sovereign and shameful indifference to the
glories of botany, had long, with suspicious and sidelong
glances, been eying the vagaries of his truant master; and
now, no sooner did he draw nigh to resume his seat and
journey, than the ungracious and ungrateful quadruped
flung aloft his head, and away he careered through the
green branches, mane streaming and saddle-bags flapping.
In vain was the brute addressed in language the most mild
and conciliatory that ever insinuated itself into horse's
lug; in vain was he ordered, [224] in tones of stern mandate,
to cease his shameless and unnatural rebellion, and
to surrender himself incontinently and without delay to
his liege: entreaty and command, remonstrance and menace,
were alike unsuccessful; and away he flew, "with flowing
tail and flying mane," in utter contempt of all former
or future vassalage. At one moment he stood the attitude
of humbleness and submission, coolly cropping the herbage
of the high banks; and then, the instant the proximity of
his much-abused master became perilous to his freedom,
aloft flew mane and tail, and away, away, the animal was
off, until an interval consistent with his new-gained license
lay behind him. After an hour of vexatious toiling through
dust and sun, a happily-executed man&#339;uvre once more
placed the most undutiful of creatures in my power. And
then, be ye sure, that in true Gilpin fashion, "whip and
spur did make amends" for all arrears of unavenged misbehaviour.</p>

<p class="noidt">was the very Christian spirit of retaliation which animated
the few succeeding miles.</p>

<p>"But something too much of this." Some pages back
I was entering the capital of Illinois. The town is approached
from the north, through a scattered forest, separating
it from the prairies; and its unusually large and
isolated buildings, few in number as they are, stationed
here and there upon the eminences of the broken surface,
give the place a singularly novel aspect viewed from the
adjacent [225] heights. There is but little of scenic attraction
about the place, and, to the traveller's eye, still
less of the picturesque. Such huge structures as are here
beheld, in a town so inconsiderable in extent, present an
unnatural and forced aspect to one who has just emerged
from the wild waste of the neighbouring prairies, sprinkled
with their humble tenements of logs. The scene is not in
keeping; it is not picturesque. Such, at all events, were
my "first impressions" on entering the village, and <i>first</i>
impressions are not necessarily false. As I drew nigh to
the huge white tavern, a host of people were swarming
the doors; and, from certain uncouth noises which from
time to time went up from the midst thereof, not an inconsiderable
portion of the worthy multitude seemed to have
succeeded in rendering themselves gloriously tipsy in honour
of the glorious day. There was one keen, bilious-looking
genius in linsey-woolsey, with a face, in its intoxicated
state, like a red-hot tomahawk, whom I regarded with
special admiration as high-priest of the bacchanal; and so
fierce and high were his objurgations, that the idea with
some force suggested itself, whether, in the course of years,
he had not screamed his lean and hungry visage to its present
hatchet-like proportions. May he forgive if I err. But not
yet were my adventures over. Having effected a retreat
from the abominations of the bar-room, I had retired to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
a chamber in the most quiet corner of the mansion, and
had seated myself to endite an epistle, when a rap at the
door announced the presence of mine host, leading along
an old [226] yeoman whom I had noticed among the revellers;
and, having given him a ceremonious introduction,
withdrew. To what circumstance I was indebted for this
unexpected honour, I was puzzling myself to divine, when
the old gentleman, after a preface of clearings of the throat
and scratchings of the head, gave me briefly to understand,
much to my admiration, that I was believed to be neither
more nor less than an "Agent for a Western Land Speculating
Company of the North," etc., etc.: and then, in a
confidential tone, before a syllable of negation or affirmation
could be offered, that he "owned a certain tract of
land, so many acres prairie, so many timber, so many
cultivated, so many wild," etc., etc.: the sequel was anticipated
by undeceiving the old farmer forthwith, though
with no little difficulty. The cause of this mistake I subsequently
discovered to be a very slight circumstance.
On the tavern register in the bar-room I had entered as
my residence my native home at the North, more for the
novelty of the idea than for anything else; or because, being
a sort of cosmopolitan, I might presume myself at liberty
to appropriate any spot I thought proper as that of my
departure or destination. As a matter of course, and with
laudable desire to augment their sum of useful knowledge,
no sooner had the traveller turned from the register than
the sagacious host and his compeer brandy-bibbers turned
towards it; and being unable to conceive any reasonable
excuse for a man to be wandering so far from his home
except for lucre's sake, the conclusion at once and irresistibly
followed that [227] the stranger was a land-speculator,
or something thereunto akin; and it required not many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
moments for such a wildfire idea to run through such an
inflammable mass of curiosity.</p>

<p>With the situation and appearance of Vandalia I was
not, as I have expressed myself, much prepossessed; indeed,
I was somewhat disappointed.<a name="FNanchor_150_153" id="FNanchor_150_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_153" class="fnanchor">150</a> Though not prepared
for anything very striking, yet in the capital of a state
we always anticipate something, if not superior or equal,
at least not inferior to neighbouring towns of less note.
Its site is an elevated, undulating tract upon the west bank
of the Kaskaskia, and was once heavily timbered, as are
now its suburbs. The streets are of liberal breadth&mdash;some
of them not less than eighty feet from kerb to kerb&mdash;enclosing
an elevated public square nearly in the centre of the
village, which a little expenditure of time and money might
render a delightful promenade. The public edifices are
very inconsiderable, consisting of an ordinary structure of
brick for legislative purposes; a similar building originally
erected as a banking establishment, but now occupied by
the offices of the state authorities; a Presbyterian Church,
with cupola and bell, besides a number of lesser buildings
for purposes of worship and education. A handsome
structure of stone for a bank is, however, in progress, which,
when completed, with other public buildings in contemplation,
will add much to the aspect of the place. Here
also is a land-office for the district, and the Cumberland
Road is permanently located and partially constructed to
the [228] place. An historical and antiquarian society has
here existed for about ten years, and its published proceedings
evince much research and information. "The Illinois
Magazine" was the name of an ably-conducted periodical
commenced at this town some years since, and prosperously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
carried on by Judge Hall, but subsequently removed to
Cincinnati.<a name="FNanchor_151_154" id="FNanchor_151_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_154" class="fnanchor">151</a> Some of the articles published in this magazine,
descriptive of the state, were of high merit. It is
passing strange that a town like Vandalia, with all the
natural and artificial advantages it possesses; located
nearly twenty years ago, by state authority, expressly as
the seat of government; situated upon the banks of a fine
stream, which small expense would render navigable for
steamers, and in the heart of a healthy and fertile region,
should have increased and flourished no more than seems
to have been the case. Vandalia will continue the seat of
government until the year 1840; when, agreeable to the
late act of Legislature, it is to be removed to Springfield,
where an appropriation of $50,000 has been made for a
state-house now in progress.</p>

<p>The growth of Vandalia, though tardy, can perhaps
be deemed so only in comparison with the more rapid
advancement of neighbouring towns; for a few years after
it was laid off it was unsurpassed in improvement by any
other. We are told that the first legislators who assembled
in session at this place sought their way through the neighbouring
prairies as the mariner steers over the trackless
ocean, by his knowledge of the cardinal points. [229] Judges
and lawyers came pouring in from opposite directions, as
wandering tribes assemble to council; and many were the
tales of adventure and mishap related at their meeting.
Some had been lost in the prairies; some had slept in the
woods; some had been almost chilled to death, plunging
through creeks and rivers. A rich growth of majestic oaks
then covered the site of the future metropolis; tangled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
thickets almost impervious to human foot surrounded it,
and all was wilderness on every side. Wonderful accounts
of the country to the north; of rich lands, and pure streams,
and prairies more beautiful than any yet discovered, soon
began to come in by the hunters.<a name="FNanchor_152_155" id="FNanchor_152_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_155" class="fnanchor">152</a> But over that country
the Indian yet roved, and the adventurous pioneer neither
owned the soil he cultivated, nor had the power to retain
its possession from the savage. Only eight years after
this, and a change, as if by magic, had come over the little
village of Vandalia; and not only so, but over the whole
state, which was now discovered to be a region more extensive
and far more fertile than the "sacred island of Britain."
The region previously the frontier formed the heart of the
fairest portion of the state, and a dozen new counties were
formed within its extent. Mail-routes and post-roads,
diverging in all directions from the capital, had been established,
and canals and railways had been projected.
Eight years more, and the "Northern frontier" is the seat
of power and population; and [230] here is removed the
seat of government, because the older settlements have not
kept pace in advancement.</p>

<p>It was a fine mellow morning when I left Vandalia to
pursue my journey over the prairies to Carlisle. For some
miles my route lay through a dense clump of old woods,
relieved at intervals by extended glades of sparser growth.
This road is but little travelled, and so obscure that for
most of the way I could avail myself of no other guide than
the "<i>blaze</i>" upon the trees; and this mark in many places,
from its ancient, weather-beaten aspect, seemed placed
there by the axe of the earliest pioneer. Rank grass has
obliterated the pathway, and overhanging boughs brush
the cheek. It was in one of those extended glades I have
mentioned that a nobly-antlered buck and his beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
doe sprang out upon the path, and stood gazing upon me
from the wayside until I had approached so near that a
rifle, even in hands all unskilled in "gentle woodcraft,"
had not been harmless. I was even beginning to meditate
upon the probable effect of a pistol-shot at twenty paces,
when the graceful animals, throwing proudly up their arching
necks, bounded off into the thicket. Not many miles
from the spot I shared the rough fare of an old hunter, who
related many interesting facts in the character and habits
of this animal, and detailed some curious anecdotes in the
history of his own wild life. He was just about leaving
his lodge on a short hunting excursion, and the absence
of a rifle alone prevented me from accepting a civil request
to bear him company.</p>

<p>[231] Most of the route from Vandalia to Carlisle is very
tolerable, with the exception of one detestable spot, fitly
named "Hurricane Bottom;" a more dreary, desolate,
purgatorial region than which, I am very free to say, exists
not in Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_153_156" id="FNanchor_153_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_156" class="fnanchor">153</a> It is a densely-wooded swamp, composed
of soft blue clay, exceedingly tenacious to the touch and
fetid in odour, extending nearly two miles. A regular highway
over this mud-hole can scarcely be said to exist, though
repeated attempts to construct one have been made at great
expense: and now the traveller, upon entering this "slough
of despond," gives his horse the reins to slump, and slide,
and plunge, and struggle through among the mud-daubed
trees to the best of his skill and ability.</p>

<p>Night overtook me in the very heart of a broad prairie;
and, like the sea, a desolate place is the prairie of a dark
night. It demanded no little exercise of the eye and judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ment
to continue upon a route where the path was constantly
diverging and varying in all directions. A bright glare of
light at a distance at length arrested my attention. On
approaching, I found it to proceed from an encampment
of tired emigrants, whose ponderous teams were wheeled up
around the blazing fire; while the hungry oxen, released from
the yoke, were browsing upon the tops of the tall prairie-grass
on every side. This grass, though coarse in appearance,
in the early stages of its growth resembles young
wheat, and furnishes a rich and succulent food for cattle.
It is even asserted that, when running at large in fields
where the young wheat covers the [232] ground, cattle choose
the prairie-grass in the margin of the field in preference
to the wheat itself. A few scattered, twinkling lights, and
the fresh-smelling air from the Kaskaskia, soon after informed
me that I was not far from the village of Carlisle.<a name="FNanchor_154_157" id="FNanchor_154_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_157" class="fnanchor">154</a>
This is a pleasant, romantic little town, upon the west bank
of the river, and upon the great stage-route through the
state from St. Louis to Vincennes. This circumstance, and
the intersection of several other state thoroughfares, give
it the animated, business-like aspect of a market town,
not often witnessed in a village so remote from the advantages
of general commerce. Its site is elevated and salubrious,
on the border of a fertile prairie: yet, notwithstanding
all these advantages, Carlisle cannot be said to have increased
very rapidly when we consider that twenty years
have elapsed since it was first laid off for a town. It is
the seat of justice for Clinton county, and can boast a wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
courthouse in "ruinous perfection." In its vicinity are some
beautiful country-seats. One of these, named "Mound
Farm," the delightful residence of Judge B&mdash;&mdash;, imbowered
in trees and shrubbery, and about a mile from the village,
I visited during my stay. It commands from its elevated
site a noble view of the neighbouring prairie, the village
and river at its foot, and the adjacent farms. Under the
superintendence of cultivated taste, this spot may become
one of the loveliest retreats in Illinois.</p>

<p>To the man of cultivated imagination and delicate taste,
the study of nature never fails to afford a gratification,
refined as it is exquisite. In the pencilled petals of the
flower as it bows to the evening breeze; in the glittering
scales of the fish leaping from the wave; in the splendid
plumage of the forest-bird, and in the music-tinklings of
the wreathed and enamelled sea-shell rocked by the billow,
he recognises an eloquence of beauty which he alone can
appreciate. For him, too, the myriad forms of animate
creation unite with inanimate nature in one mighty hymn
of glory to their Maker, from the hum of the sparkling
ephemeroid as he blithely dances away his little life in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
beams of a summer sun, and the rustling music of the prairie-weed
swept by the winds, to the roar of the shaggy woods
upon the mountain-side, and the fierce, wild shriek of the
ocean-eagle. To investigate [234] the more minute and
delicate of Nature's workings is indeed a delightful task;
and along this fairy and flowery pathway the cultivated
fancy revels with unmingled gratification; but, as the mind
approaches the vaster exhibitions of might and majesty,
the booming of the troubled ocean, the terrible sublimity of
the midnight storm, the cloudy magnificence of the mountain
height, the venerable grandeur of the aged forest, it expands
itself in unison till lost in the immensity of created things.
Reflections like these are constantly suggesting themselves to
the traveller's thoughts amid the grand scenery of the West;
but at no season do they rise more vividly upon the mind
than when the lengthened shadows of evening are stealing
over the landscape, and the summer sun is sinking to his
rest. This is the "magic hour" when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bright clouds are gathering one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping in pomp round the dying sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crimson banner and golden pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a host to their chieftain's funeral."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">There is not a more magnificent spectacle in nature than
summer sunset on the Western prairie. I have beheld the
orb of day, after careering his course like a giant through
the firmament, go down into the fresh tumbling billows of
ocean; and sunset on the prairies, which recalls that scene,
is alone equalled by it.</p>

<p>Near nightfall one evening I found myself in the middle
of one of these vast extended plains, where the eye roves
unconfined over the scene, for miles unrelieved by a stump,
or a tree, or a thicket, and meets only the deep blue of the
horizon on [235] every side, blending with the billowy foliage
of the distant woodland. Descending a graceful slope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
even this object is lost, and a boundless landscape of blue
above and green below is unfolded to the traveller's vision;
again, approaching the summit of the succeeding slope,
the forest rises in clear outline in the margin of the
vast panorama. For some hours the heavens had been so
enveloped in huge masses of brassy clouds, that now, when
the shadows deepened over sky and earth, one was at a loss
to determine whether the sun had yet gone down, except
for a broad zone of sapphire girding the whole western
firmament. Upon the superior edge of this deep belt now
glistened the luminary, gradually revealing itself to the eye,
and blazing forth at length "like angels' locks unshorn,"
flinging a halo of golden effulgence far athwart the dim
evening prairie. A metamorphosis so abrupt, so rapid,
so unlooked for, seemed almost to realize the fables of
enchantment. One moment, and the whole vast landscape
lay veiled in shadowy dimness; the next, and every grass
blade, and spray, and floweret, and nodding wild-weed
seemed suffused in a flood of liquid effulgence; while far
along, the uniform ridges of the heaving plain gleamed in
the rich light like waves of a moonlit sea, sweeping away,
roll upon roll, till lost in distance to the eye. Slowly the
splendid disk went down behind the sea of waving verdure,
until at length a single point of intense, bewildering brightness
flamed out above the mass of green. An instant, this
too was gone&mdash;as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"An angel's wing through an opening cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is seen and then withdrawn:"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">[236] and then those deep, lurid funeral fires of departing
day streamed, flaring upward even to the zenith, flinging
over the vast concave a robe of unearthly, terrible magnificence!
Then, as the fount of all this splendour sank deeper
and deeper beneath the horizon, the blood-red flames died
gently away into the mellow glories of summer evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
skylight, bathing the brow of heaven in a tender roseate,
which hours after cheered the lonely traveller across the
waste.</p>

<p>The pilgrim wanderer in other climes comes back to tell
us of sunnier skies and softer winds! The blue heavens
of Italy have tasked the inspiration of an hundred bards,
and the warm brush of her own Lorraine has swept the
canvass with their gorgeous transcript! But what pencil
has wandered over the grander scenes of the North American
prairie? What bard has struck his lyre to the wild
melody of loveliness of the prairie sunset? Yet who shall
tell us that there exists not a glory in the scene, amid the
untrod wastes of the wilderness West, which even the
skies of "sunny Italy" might not blush anew to acknowledge?
No wandering Harold has roamed on a pilgrimage
of poetry over the sublime and romantic scenery of our
land, to hymn its praise in breathing thoughts and glowing
words; yet here as there,</p>

<p>I cannot tell of the beauties of climes I have never seen;
but I have gazed upon all the varied loveliness of my own
fair, native land, from the rising [237] sun to its setting,
and in vain have tasked my fancy to image a fairer.</p>

<p>A pleasant day's ride directly west from Carlisle, over
extensive and beautiful prairies, intersected by shady woods,
with their romantic creeks, and the traveller finds himself
in the quiet village of Lebanon. Its site is a commanding,
mound-like elevation in the skirts of a forest, swelling gently
up from the prairie on the west bank of Little Silver Creek.<a name="FNanchor_155_158" id="FNanchor_155_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_158" class="fnanchor">155</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
This stream, with the larger branch, received its name from
the circumstance that the early French settlers of the
country, in the zeal of their faith and research for the
precious metals, a long while mistook the brilliant specula of
<i>horneblende</i> which flow in its clear waters for silver, and were
unwilling to be undeceived in their extravagant anticipations
until the absence of the material in their purses aroused
them from their error. In the neighbourhood of Rock
Spring a shaft for a mine was sunk.<a name="FNanchor_156_159" id="FNanchor_156_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_159" class="fnanchor">156</a> It was early one
beautiful morning that I found myself approaching the
village of Lebanon, though many miles distant in the
adjacent plain; appropriately named for its loveliness the
"Looking-glass Prairie." The rosy sunbeams were playing
lightly over the pleasant country-seats and neat farmhouses,
with their white palings, sprinkled along the declivity before
me, imbowered in their young orchards and waving maize-fields;
while flocks and herds, [238] gathered in isolated
masses over the intervening meadow, were cropping the rich
herbage. To the right and left, and in the rear, the prairie
stretches away beyond the view. The body of the village
is situated about one mile from these suburbs, and its character
and history may be summed up in the single sentence,
<i>a pleasant little Methodist country village</i>. The peculiarities
of the sect are here strikingly manifested to the traveller in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>all the ordinary concerns and occupations of life, even in
the every-day garb and conversation of its sober-browed
citizens. It presents the spectacle, rare as it is cheering,
of an entire community characterized by its reverence for
religion. Located in its immediate vicinity is a flourishing
seminary, called McKendreean College.<a name="FNanchor_157_160" id="FNanchor_157_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_160" class="fnanchor">157</a> It is under the
supervision of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and has
at present two instructers, with about fifty pupils in the
preparatory department. It has a commodious frame building,
presenting from its elevated site an imposing view to
the traveller. As is usually the case with these little out-of-the-world
villages, when any object comes up in the
midst around which the feelings and interests of all may
cluster, upon this institution is centred the heart and soul
of every man, to say not a word of all the women and children,
in Lebanon; and everything not connected, either
remotely or immediately, with its welfare, is deemed of
very little, if of any importance. "<i>The Seminary! The
Seminary!</i>" I defy a traveller to tarry two hours in the
village without hearing rung all the changes upon that
topic for his edification. The surrounding region is fertile,
populous, [239] and highly cultivated; and for an
inland, farming village, it is quite as bustling, I suppose, as
should be expected; though, during my visit, its streets&mdash;which,
by-the-by, are of very liberal breadth&mdash;maintained
a most Sabbath-like aspect.</p>

<p>The route from Lebanon to Belleville is, in fine weather,
very excellent. Deep woods on either side of the hard,
smooth, winding pathway, throw their boughs over the
head, sometimes lengthening away into an arched vista<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
miles in extent. It was a sultry afternoon when I was
leisurely travelling along this road; and the shadowy coolness
of the atmosphere, the perfume of wild flowers and
aromatic herbs beneath the underbrush, and the profusion
of summer fruit along the roadside, was indescribably
delightful. Near sunset, a graceful bend of the road
around a clump of trees placed before me the pretty little
village of Belleville; its neat enclosures and white cottages
peeping through the shrubbery, now gilded by the mellow
rays of sunset in every leaf and spray.<a name="FNanchor_158_161" id="FNanchor_158_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_161" class="fnanchor">158</a> Whether it was
owing to this agreeable coincidence, or to the agreeable
visit I here enjoyed, that I conceived such an attachment
for the place, I cannot say; but sure it is, I fell in love with
the little town at <i>first</i> sight; and, what is more marvellous,
was not, according to all precedent, cured at second, when
on the following morning I sallied forth to reconnoitre its
beauties "at mine own good leisure." Now it is to be
presumed that, agreeable to the taste of six travellers in a
dozen, I have passed through many a village in Illinois
quite as attractive as this same Belleville: but to convince
me of the fact would be no [240] easy task. "Man is the
sport of circumstance," says the fatalist; and however this
may be in the moral world, if any one feels disposed to
doubt upon the matter in the item before us, let him disembark
from a canal-boat at Pittsburgh on a rainy, misty,
miserable morning; and then, unable to secure for his houseless
head a shelter from the pitiless peltings, let him hurry
away through the filthy streets, deluged with inky water,
to a crowded Ohio steamer; and if "<i>circumstances</i>" do not
force him to dislike Pittsburgh ever after, then his human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
nature is vastly more forbearing than my own. Change
the picture. Let him enter the quiet little Illinois village
at the gentle hour of sunset; let him meet warm hospitality,
and look upon fair forms and bright faces, and if he fail
to be pleased with that place, why, "he's not the man I
took him for."</p>

<p>The public buildings of Belleville are a handsome courthouse
of brick, a wretched old jail of the same material,
a public hall belonging to a library company, and a small
framed Methodist house of worship. It is situated in the
centre of "Turkey-hill Settlement," one of the oldest and
most flourishing in the state, and has a fine timber tract
and several beautiful country-seats in its vicinity.</p>

<p>Leaving Belleville with some reluctance, and not a few
"longing, lingering looks behind," my route continued
westward over a broken region of alternating forest and
prairie, sparsely sprinkled with trees, and yet more sparsely
with inhabitants. At length, having descended a precipitous
hill, the rounded summit of which, as well as the adjoining
heights, commanded an immense expanse of level
[241] landscape, stretching off from the base, I stood once
more upon the fertile soil of the "<i>American Bottom</i>." The
sharp, heavy-roofed French cottages, with low verandahs
running around; the ungainly outhouses and enclosures;
the curiously-fashioned vehicles and instruments of husbandry
in the barnyards and before the doors; the foreign
garb and dialect of the people; and, above all, the amazing
fertility of the soil, over whose exhaustless depths the maize
has rustled half a century, constitute the most striking characteristics
of this interesting tract, in the section over which
I was passing. This settlement, extending from the foot
of the bluffs for several miles over the Bottom, was formed
about forty years ago by a colony from Cahokia, and known
by the name of "<i>Little French Village</i>;" it now comprises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
about twenty houses and a grogshop. In these bluffs lies
an exhaustless bed of bituminous coal: vast quantities have
been transported to St. Louis, and for this purpose principally
is the railway to the river designed. This vein of
coal is said to have been discovered by the rivulet of a spring
issuing from the base of the bluffs. The stratum is about
six feet in thickness, increasing in size as it penetrates the
hill horizontally. Though somewhat rotten and slaty, it
is in some particulars not inferior to the coal of the Alleghanies;
and the vein is thought to extend from the mouth
of the Kaskaskia to that of the Illinois. About three miles
below the present shaft, a continuation of the bed was discovered
by fire communicated from the root of a tree; the
bank of coal burnt for upward of a [242] twelvemonth, and
the conflagration was then smothered only by the falling
in of the superincumbent soil. St. Clair county, which
embraces a large portion of the American Bottom, is the
oldest settlement in the state. In 1795 the county was
formed by the Legislature of the Northwestern Territory,
and then included all settlements in Illinois east of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>I had just cleverly cleared the outskirts of the little antediluvian
village beneath the bluffs, when a dark, watery-looking
cloud came tumbling up out of the west; the thunder
roared across the Bottom and was reverberated from the
cliffs, and in a few moments down came the big rain-drops
dancing in torrents from the clouds, and pattering up like
mist along the plain. Verily, groaned forth the wo-begone
traveller, this is the home of clouds and the realm of
thunder! Never did hapless mortals sustain completer
drenchings than did the traveller and his steed, notwithstanding
upon the first onset they had plunged themselves
into the sheltering depths of the wood. A half hour's
gallop over the slippery bottom, and the stern roar of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
steamer's 'scape-pipe informed me that I was not far from
the "great waters." A few yards through the belt of forest,
and the city of San Louis, with towers and roofs, stood before
me.</p>

<p><i>St. Louis.</i></p>

<p>Ah, the single blessedness of the unmarried state! Such
is the sentiment of an ancient worthy, quietly expressed
in the lines which I have selected for a motto. After
dozing away half his days and all his energies within the
dusky walls of a university, tumbling over musty tomes and
shrivelled parchments until his very brain had become
cobwebbed as the alcoves he haunted, and the blood in
his veins was all "adust and thin;" then, forsooth, the
shameless old fellow issues forth with his vainglorious
sentiment upon his lips! And yet, now that we consider,
there is marvellous "method" in the old man's "madness!"
In very truth and soberness, there is a blessedness
which the bachelor can boast, <i>single</i> though it be, in
which the "man of family," though <i>doubly</i> blessed, cannot
share! To the former, life may be made one long holyday,
and its path a varied and flowery one! while to
the poor [244] victim of matrimonial toils, <i>wife and children</i>
are the Alpha and Omega of a weary existence!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Of all travelling companionship, forfend us from that of
a married man! Independence! He knows not of it!
Such is the text and such the commentary: now for the
practical application.</p>

<p>It was a balmy July morning, and the flutelike melody
of the turtle-dove was ringing through the woodlands.
Leaving the pleasant villa of Dr. F. in the environs of
North St. Louis, I found myself once more fairly <i>en route</i>,
winding along that delightful road which sweeps the
western bottom of the Mississippi. Circumstances not
within my control, Benedict though I am, had recalled me,
after a ramble of but a few weeks over the prairies, again
to the city, and compelled me to relinquish my original
design of a tour of the extreme Northwest. Ah, the despotism
of circumstance! My delay, however, proved a
brief, though pleasant one; and with a something of
mingled <i>regret</i> and anticipation it was that I turned from
the bright eyes and dark locks of St. Louis&mdash;"forgive
my folly"&mdash;and once again beheld its imposing structures
fade in distance.</p>

<p>By far the most delightful drive in the vicinity of St. Louis
is that of four or five miles in its northern suburbs, along
the river bottom. The road, emerging from the streets of
the city through one of its finest sections, and leaving the
"Big Mound" upon the right, sweeps off for several miles
upon a succession of broad plateaux, rolling up from the
water's edge. To the left lies an extensive range of heights,
surmounted by ancient mounds and crowned with [245]
groves of the shrub-oak, which afford a delightful shade
to the road running below. Along this elevated ridge beautiful
country-seats, with graceful piazzas and green Venitian
blinds, are caught from time to time glancing through the
shrubbery; while to the right, smooth meadows spread
themselves away to the heavy belt of forest which margins the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Mississippi. Among these pleasant villas the little white
farm-cottage, formerly the residence of Mr. C., beneath the
hills, surrounded by its handsome grounds, and gardens,
and glittering fishponds, partially shrouded by the broad
leaved catalpa, the willow, the acacia, and other ornamental
trees, presents, perhaps, the rarest instance of natural beauty
adorned by refined taste. A visit to this delightful spot
during my stay at St. Louis informed me of the fact that,
within as well as abroad, the hand of education and refinement
had not been idle. Paintings, busts, medallions,
Indian curiosities, &amp;c., &amp;c., tastefully arranged around
the walls and shelves of an elegant library, presented a
feast to the visiter as rare in the Far West as it is agreeable
to a cultivated mind. Near this cottage is the intended
site of the building of the St. Louis Catholic University,
a lofty and commanding spot.<a name="FNanchor_159_162" id="FNanchor_159_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_162" class="fnanchor">159</a> A considerable tract was
here purchased, at a cost of thirty thousand dollars; but
the design of removal from the city has for the present been
relinquished. Immediately adjoining is situated the stately
villa of Colonel O'Fallon, with its highly-cultivated gardens
and its beautiful park sweeping off in the rear. In
a very few years this must become one of the most delightful
spots [246] in the West. For its elegant grounds, its
green and hot houses, and its exotic and indigenous plants,
it is, perhaps, already unequalled west of Cincinnati. No
expense, attention, or taste will be wanting to render it all
of which the spot is capable.</p>

<p>Leaving the Bottom, the road winds gracefully off from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the Mississippi, over the hard soil of the bluffs, through a
region broken up by sink-holes, and covered with a meager
growth of oaks, with small farms at intervals along the
route, until at length the traveller finds himself at that
beautiful spot on the Missouri, Belle Fontaine, fifteen miles
from St. Louis. On account of the salubrity and beauty
of the site, an army cantonment was located here by General
Wilkinson in the early part of the present century,
and fortifications consisting of palisade-work existed, and a
line of log-barracks sufficient to quarter half a regiment.
Nothing now remains but a pile of ruins. "The barracks
have crumpled into dust, and the ploughshare has passed
over the promenade of the sentinel." Jefferson Barracks,
in the southern environs of the city, have superseded the
old fortress, and the spot has been sold to a company,
which has here laid off a town; and as most of the lots
have been disposed of, and a turnpike-road from St. Louis
has been chartered, a succeeding tourist may, at no distant
period, pencil it in his notebook "a flourishing village."
<i>Cold Water Creek</i> is the name of a clear stream
which empties itself into the Missouri just above, upon
which are several mill-privileges; and from the base of the
bluff itself gushes a fountain, on account [247] of which
the place received its name from the French. The site
for the new town is a commanding and beautiful one, being
a bold, green promontory, rising from the margin of
the stream about four miles above its confluence with the
Mississippi. The view developed to the eye of the spectator
from this spot on a fine day is one of mingled sublimity
and beauty. For some miles these old giants of
the West are beheld roaming along through their deep,
fertile valleys, so different in character and aspect that one
can hardly reconcile with that diversity the fact that their
destiny is soon to become <i>one</i> and unchangeably the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
And then comes the mighty "meeting of the waters," to
which no pen can hope to render justice.</p>

<p>There is a singular circumstance related of the discovery
of a large <i>human tooth</i> many years since at Belle Fontaine,
in excavating a well, when at the depth of forty feet. This
was the more extraordinary as the spot was not alluvion,
and could have undergone no change from natural causes
for centuries. Various strata of clay were passed through
before the <i>tooth</i> was thrown up; and this circumstance,
together with the situation of the place, would almost
preclude the possibility of a vein of subterraneous water
having conveyed it to the spot. This is mysterious enough,
certainly; but the fact is authentic.</p>

<p>Returning at an angle of forty-five degrees with the road
by which he approaches, a ride of a dozen miles up the
Missouri places the traveller upon a bold roll of the prairie,
from which, in the beautiful [248] valley below, rising above
the forest, appear the steep roofs and tall chimneys of the
little hamlet of Florissant.<a name="FNanchor_160_163" id="FNanchor_160_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_163" class="fnanchor">160</a> Its original name was St.
Ferdinand, titular saint of its church; and though one of
the most advanced in years, it is by no means the most
antique-looking of those ancient villages planted by the early
French. Its site is highly romantic, upon the banks of a
creek of the same name, and in the heart of one of the
most fertile and luxuriant valleys ever subjected to cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_161_164" id="FNanchor_161_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_164" class="fnanchor">161</a>
The village now embraces about thirty or forty
irregular edifices, somewhat modernized in style and structure,
surrounded by extensive corn-fields, wandering flocks
of Indian ponies, and herds of cattle browsing in the plain.
Here also is a Catholic Church, a neat building of brick,
with belfry and bell; connected with which is a convent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of nuns, and by these is conducted a Seminary for young
ladies of some note. This institution&mdash;if the Hibernian
hostess of the little inn at which I dined is to be credited
in her statements&mdash;is the most flourishing establishment
in all the region far and near! and "<i>heducates</i> the young
<i>leddies</i> in everything but religion!" For the redoubtable
<i>Tonish</i>, who whilom figured so bravely on the prairies and
in print, I made diligent inquiry. His cottage&mdash;the best
in the village&mdash;and a dirty little brood of his posterity, were
pointed out to me, but the old worthy himself was, as usual,
in the regions of the Rocky Mountains: when last seen, he
could still tell the stoutest lie with the steadiest muscles of
any man in the village, while he and his [249] hopeful son
could cover each other's trail so nicely that a lynx-eye
would fail to detect them. In the vicinity of Florissant
is a settlement called Owen's Station, formerly the site of
a stoccade fort for defence against the Indians, and of
a Spanish <i>station</i> on account of a fine fountain in the vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_162_165" id="FNanchor_162_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_165" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>The direct route from St. Louis to Florissant is an excellent
one, over a high rolling prairie, and commands a noble
sweep of scenery. From several elevated points, the white
cliffs beyond the American Bottom, more than twenty miles
distant, may be seen, while farmhouses and villas are beheld
in all directions gleaming through the groves. Scenery
of the same general character presents itself upon the direct
route to St. Charles, with the exception of steeper hills and
broader plains. Upon this route my path entered nearly
at right angles soon after leaving the French village. Upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the right shore of the Missouri, not far above Florissant, is
situated <i>La Charbonni&egrave;re</i>, a name given to a celebrated
coal-bank in a bluff about two hundred feet in altitude,
and about twice as long.<a name="FNanchor_163_166" id="FNanchor_163_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_166" class="fnanchor">163</a> The stratum of coal is about
a dozen feet in thickness, and lies directly upon the
margin of the river: the quantity in the bank is said to
be immense, and it contains an unusual proportion of
bitumen. Iron ore has also been discovered at this spot.</p>

<p>The road over the Missouri Bottom was detestable, as
never fails to be the case after a continued rain-storm, and
my horse's leg sank to the middle in the black, unctuous
loam almost at every step. Upon either side, like colonnades,
rose up those [250] enormous shafts of living verdure
which strike the solitary traveller upon these unfrequented
bottoms with such awe and veneration; while the huge
whirls of the writhing wild-vine hung dangling, like
gigantic serpents, from the lofty columns around whose
capitals they clung. On descending the bluffs to the bottom,
the traveller crosses a bed of limestone, in which is said
to exist a fissure perfectly fathomless. In a few moments,
the boiling, turbid floods of the Missouri are beheld rolling
majestically along at the feet, and to the stranger's eye, at
first sight, always suggesting the idea of <i>unusual</i> agitation;
but so have they rolled onward century after century, age
after age. The wild and impetuous character of this river,
together with the vast quantities of soil with which its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
waters are charged, impart to it a natural sublimity far more
striking, at first view, than that of the Mississippi. This
circumstance was not unobserved by the Indian tribes,
who appropriately named it the "<i>Smoky Water</i>:" by others
it was styled the "<i>Mad River</i>," on account of the impetuosity
of its current; and in all dialects it is called the "<i>Mother
of Floods</i>," indicative of the immense volume of its waters.
Various causes have been assigned for the turbid character
of the Missouri: and though, doubtless, heavily charged by
the volumes of sand thrown into its channel by the Yellow
Stone&mdash;its longest tributary, equal to the Ohio&mdash;and by
the chalky clay of the White River, yet we are told that
it is characterized by the same phenomenon from its very
source. At the gates of the Rocky Mountains, where,
having torn [251] for itself a channel through the everlasting
hills, it comes rushing out through the vast prairie-plains
at their base, it is the same dark, wild torrent as at its turbid
embouchure. And, strange to tell, after roaming thousands
of miles, and receiving into its bosom streams equal to itself,
and hundreds of lesser, though powerful tributaries, it still
retains, unaltered, in depth or breadth, that volume which
at last it rolls into its mighty rival! Torrent after torrent,
river after river, pour in their floods, yet the giant stream
rolls majestically onward unchanged! At the village of
St. Charles its depth and breadth is the same as at the
Mandan villages, nearly two thousand miles nearer its
source.<a name="FNanchor_164_167" id="FNanchor_164_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_167" class="fnanchor">164</a> The same inexplicable phenomenon characterizes
the Mississippi, and, indeed, all the great rivers of the
West; for <i>inexplicable</i> the circumstance yet remains, however
plausible the theories alleged in explanation. With
regard to the Missouri, it is urged that the porous, sandy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
soil of its broad alluvions absorbs, on the principle of
capillary attraction, much of its volume, conveying it by
subterraneous channels to the Mississippi; and of this latter
stream it is asserted that large quantities of its waters are
taken up by the innumerable bayous, lakes, and lagoons
intersecting the lower region of its course; and thus,
unperceived, they find their way to the gulf.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Missouri is thought to be the most
hazardous and difficult of any of the Western rivers, owing
to its mad, impetuous current, to the innumerable obstructions
in its bed, and the incessant variation of its channel.<a name="FNanchor_165_168" id="FNanchor_165_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_168" class="fnanchor">165</a>
Insurance and pilotage [252] upon this river are higher than
on others; the season of navigation is briefer, and steamers
never pursue their course after dusk. Its vast length and
numerous tributaries render it liable, also, to frequent floods,
of which three are expected every year. The chief of these
takes place in the month of June, when the heaped-up
snows of the Rocky Mountains are melted, and, having
flowed thousands of miles through the prairies, reach the
Mississippi. The ice and snows of the Alleghanies, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the wild-rice lakes of the far Upper Mississippi, months
before have reached their destination, and thus a general
inundation, unavoidable had the floods been simultaneous,
is prevented by Providence. The alluvions of the Missouri
are said to be higher than, and not so broad as, those of
the Mississippi; yet their extent is constantly varying by
the violence of the current, even more than those of the
latter stream. Many years ago the flourishing town of
Franklin was completely torn away from its foundations,
and its inhabitants were forced to flee to the adjacent heights;
and the bottom opposite St. Charles and at numerous other
places has, within the few years past, suffered astonishing
changes.<a name="FNanchor_166_169" id="FNanchor_166_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_169" class="fnanchor">166</a> Opposite the town now flow the waters of the
river where once stood farms and orchards.</p>

<p>The source of the Missouri and that of the Columbia,
we are told, are in such immediate proximity, that a walk
of but a few miles will enable the traveller to drink from
the fountains of each. Yet how unlike their destiny! One
passes off through a region of boundless prairie equal in
extent to a [253] sixth of our globe; and, after a thousand
wanderings, disembogues its troubled waters into the Mexican
Gulf; the other, winding away towards the setting
sun, rolls on through forests untrodden by human footstep
till it sleeps in the Pacific Seas. Their destinies reach their
fulfilment at opposite extremes of a continent! How like,
how very like are the destinies of these far, lonely rivers to
the destinies of human life! Those who, in the beautiful
starlight of our boyhood, were our schoolmates and play-fellows,
where are they when our sun of ripened maturity
has reached its meridian? and what, and where are they
and we, when evening's lengthening shadows are gathering
over the landscape of life? Our paths diverged but little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
at first, but mountains, continents, half a world of waters
may divide our destinies, and opposite extremes of "the
great globe itself" witness their consummation. Yet, like
the floods of the far-winding rivers, the streams of our
existences will meet again, and mingle in the ocean&mdash;that
ocean without a shore&mdash;<i>ETERNITY</i>!</p>

<p>The gates of the Rocky Mountains, through which the
waters of the Missouri rush forth into the prairies of the
great Valley, are described as one of the sublimest spectacles
in nature. Conceive the floods of a powerful mountain-torrent
compressed in mid career into a width of less than
one hundred and fifty yards, rushing with the speed of
"the wild horse's wilder sire" through a chasm whose vast
walls of Nature's own masonry rear themselves on either
side from the raging waters to the precipitous [254] height
of twelve hundred perpendicular feet; and then consider
if imagination can compass a scene of darker, more terrible
sublimity! And then sweep onward with the current, and
within one hundred miles you behold a cataract, next to
Niagara, from all description grandest in the world. Such
are some of the mighty features of the stream upon which
I was now standing.</p>

<p>As to the much disputed question which of the great
streams of the West is entitled to the name of the <i>Main
River</i>, I shall content myself with a brief statement of the
arguments alleged in support of the pretensions of either
claimant. The volume of the Missouri at the confluence
far exceeds that of its rival; the length of its course and
the number and magnitude of its tributaries are also greater,
and it imparts a character to the united streams. On the
other hand, the Mississippi, geographically and geologically
considered, is the grand Central River of the continent,
maintaining an undeviating course from north to south;
the valley which it drains is far more extensive and fertile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
than that of the Missouri; and from the circumstance of
having first been explored, it has given a name to the great
river of the Western Valley which it will probably ever
retain, whatever the right. "<i>Sed non nostrum tantas componere
lites.</i>"</p>

<p>The view of St. Charles from the opposite bank of the
Missouri is a fine one. The turbid stream rolls along the
village nearly parallel with the interval upon which it is
situated. A long line of neat edifices, chiefly of brick, with
a few ruinous old structures of logs and plastering, relics
of French or Spanish taste and domination, extend along
the shore; beyond these, a range of bluffs rear themselves
proudly above the village, crowned with their academic
hall and a neat stone church, its spire surmounted by the
cross. Between these structures, upon a spot somewhat
more elevated, appears the basement section of "a stern
round tower of former days," now a ruin; and, though a
very peaceable [10] pile of limestone and mortar, well-fitted
in distant view to conjure up a host of imaginings: like
Shenstone's Ruined Abbey, forsooth,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Or bound our vistas."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The history of the tower, if tower it may be styled, is
briefly this.<a name="FNanchor_167_170" id="FNanchor_167_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_170" class="fnanchor">167</a> During the era of Spanish rule in this region,
before its cession to France half a century since,
this structure was erected as a watch-tower or magazine.
Subsequently it was dismantled, and partially fell to ruins,
when the novel project was started to plant a <i>windmill</i>
upon the foundation. This was done; but either the wind
was too high or too low, too frequent or too rare, or neither;
or there was no corn to grind, or the projector despaired
of success, or some other of the fifty untoward circumstances
which suggest themselves came to pass; the windmill ere
long fell to pieces, and left the old ruin to the tender
mercies of time and tempest, a monument of chance and
change.</p>

<p>The evening of my arrival at St. Charles I strolled off
at about sunset, and, ascending the bluffs, approached the
old ruin. The walls of rough limestone are massively
deep, and the altitude cannot now be less than twenty feet.
The view from the spot is noble, and peculiarly impressive
at the sunset hour. Directly at your feet lies the village,
from the midst of which come up the rural sounds of evening;
the gladsome laugh of children at their sports; the
whistle of the home-plodding labourer; the quiet hum of
gossips around the open doors; [11] while upon the river's
brink a huge steam-mill sends forth its ceaseless "boom,
boom" upon the still air. Beneath the village ripples the
Missouri, with a fine sweep both above and below the town
not unlike the letter S; while beyond the stream extends
its heavily-timbered bottom: one cluster of trees directly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
opposite are Titanic in dimensions. Upon the summit of
the bluff, in the shadow of the ruin by your side, lies a
sunken grave. It is the grave of a <i>duellist</i>. Over it trail
the long, melancholy branches of a weeping willow. A
neat paling once protected the spot from the wanderer's
footstep, but it is gone now; only a rotten relic remains.
All is still. The sun has long since gone down. One after
another the evening sounds have died away in the village
at the feet, and one after another the lights have twinkled
forth from the casements. A fresh breeze is coming up
from the water; the rushing wing of the night-hawk strikes
fitfully upon the ear; and yonder sails the beautiful "boat
of light," the pale sweet crescent. On that crescent is
gazing many a distant friend! What a spot&mdash;what
an hour to meditate upon the varying destinies of life!
I seated myself upon the foot of the grave, which still
retained some little elevation from the surrounding soil,
and the night-wind sighed through the trailing boughs as
if a requiem to him who slumbered beneath. <i>Requiescat
in pace</i>, in no meaningless ceremony, might be pronounced
over him, for his end was a troubled one. Unfortunate
man! you have gone to your account; and that tabernacle
in which once burned a beautiful flame has long since been
mingling with the dust: [12] but I had rather be even as
thou art, cold in an unhonoured grave, than to live on
and wear away a miserable remnant of existence, that
"guilty thing" with crimsoned hand and brow besprinkled
with blood. To drag out a weary length of days and nights;
to feel life a bitterness, and all its verdure scathed; to walk
about among the ranks of men a being</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Mark'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sign'd, and quoted for a deed of shame;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">to feel a stain upon the palm which not all the waters of
ocean could wash away; a smell of blood which not all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the perfumes of Arabia could sweeten; ah! give me death
rather than this! That the custom of duelling, under the
present arrangements of society and code of honour, in
some sections of our country, is necessary, is more than
problematical; that its practice will continue to exist is
certain; but, when death ensues, "'tis the surviver dies."</p>

<p>The stranger has never, perhaps, stood upon the bluffs
of St. Charles without casting a glance of anxious interest
upon that lone, deserted grave; and there are associated
with its existence circumstances of melancholy import.
Twenty years ago, he who lies there was a young, accomplished
barrister of superior abilities, distinguished rank,
and rapidly rising to eminence in the city of St. Louis.
Unhappily, for words uttered in the warmth of political
controversy, offence was taken; satisfaction demanded; a
meeting upon that dark and bloody ground opposite the
city ensued; and poor B&mdash;&mdash; fell, in the sunshine of his
spring, lamented by all [13] who had known him. Agreeable
to his request in issue of his death, his remains were
conveyed to this spot and interred. Years have since
rolled away, and the melancholy event is now among forgotten
things; but the old ruin, beneath whose shadow he
slumbers, will long remain his monument; and the distant
traveller, when he visits St. Charles, will pause and ponder
over his lonely grave.<a name="FNanchor_168_171" id="FNanchor_168_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_171" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>Ah! the valuable blood which has steeped the sands of
that steril island in the Mississippi opposite St. Louis!
Nearly thirty years ago a fatal encounter took place between
Dr. F. and Dr. G., in which the latter fell: that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
between young B. and a Mr. C. I have alluded to, and
several other similar combats transpired on the spot at
about the same time. The bloody affair between Lieutenants
Biddle and Pettis, and that between Lucas and
Benton, are of more recent date, and, with several others,
are familiar in the memory of all. The spot has been fitly
named "Murder" or "Blood Island."<a name="FNanchor_169_172" id="FNanchor_169_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_172" class="fnanchor">169</a> Lying in the
middle of the stream, it is without the jurisdiction of either
of the adjoining states; and deep is the curse which has
descended upon its shores!</p>

<p>[14] The morning star was beaming beautifully forth
from the blue eastern heavens when I mounted my horse
for a visit to that celebrated spot, "<i>Les Mamelles</i>." A
pleasant ride of three miles through the forest-path beneath
the bluffs brought me at sunrise to the spot. Every
tree was wreathed with the wild rose like a rainbow; and
the breeze was laden with perfume. It is a little singular,
the difficulty with which visiters usually meet in finding
this place. The Duke of Saxe Weimar, among other dignitaries,
when on his tour of the West several years since,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
tells us that he lost his way in the neighbouring prairie
by pursuing the river road instead of that beneath the bluffs.
The natural eminences which have obtained the appropriate
appellation of Mamelles, from their striking resemblance
to the female breast, are a pair of lofty, conical mounds,
from eighty to one hundred feet altitude, swelling up perfectly
naked and smooth upon the margin of that celebrated
prairie which owes to them a name. So beautifully are
they paired and so richly rounded, that it would hardly
require a Frenchman's eye or that of an Indian to detect
the resemblance designated, remarkable though both races
have shown themselves for bestowing upon objects in
natural scenery significant names. Though somewhat
resembling those artificial earth-heaps which form such
an interesting feature of the West, these mounds are, doubtless,
but a broken continuation of the Missouri bluffs, which
at this point terminate from the south, while those of the
Mississippi, commencing at the same point, stretch away
at right angles to the west. [15] The mounds are of an
oblong, elliptical outline, parallel to each other, in immediate
proximity, and united at the extremities adjoining
the range of highlands by a curved elevation somewhat
less in height. They are composed entirely of earth, and
in their formation are exceedingly uniform and graceful.
Numerous springs of water gush out from their base. But
an adequate conception of these interesting objects can
hardly be conveyed by the pen; at all events, without somewhat
more of the quality of patience than chances to be
the gift of my own wayward instrument. In brief, then,
imagine a huge <i>spur</i>, in fashion somewhat like to that of
a militia major, with the enormous rowel stretching off to
the south, and the heel-bow rounding away to the northeast
and northwest, terminated at each extremity by a vast
excrescence; imagine all this spread out in the margin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of an extended prairie, and a tolerably correct, though
inadequate idea of the outline of the Mamelles is obtained.
The semicircular area in the bow of the spur between the
mounds is a deep dingle, choked up with stunted trees
and tangled underbrush of hazels, sumach, and wild-berry,
while the range of highlands crowned with forest goes back
in the rear. This line of heights extends up the Missouri
for some distance, at times rising directly from the water's
edge to the height of two hundred feet, rough and ragged,
but generally leaving a heavily-timbered bottom several
miles in breadth in the interval, and in the rear rolling off
into high, undulating prairie. The bluffs of the Mississippi
extend to the westward in a similar [16] manner, but
the prairie interval is broader and more liable to inundation.
The distance from the Mamelles to the confluence
of the rivers is, by their meanderings, about twenty or
thirty miles, and is very nearly divided into prairie and
timber. The extremity of the point is liable to inundation,
and its growth of forest is enormous.</p>

<p>The view from the summit of the Mamelles, as the morning
sun was flinging over the landscape his ruddy dyes,
was one of eminent, surpassing loveliness. It is celebrated,
indeed, as the most beautiful prairie-scene in the Western
Valley, and one of the most romantic views in the country.
To the right extends the Missouri Bottom, studded with
farms of the French villagers, and the river-bank margined
with trees which conceal the stream from the eye. Its
course is delineated, however, by the blue line of bluffs
upon the opposite side, gracefully curving towards the
distant Mississippi until the trace fades away at the confluence.
In front is spread out the lovely Mamelle Prairie,
with its waving ocean of rich flowers of every form, and
scent, and hue, while green groves are beheld swelling out
into its bosom, and hundreds of cattle are cropping the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
herbage. In one direction the view is that of a boundless
plain of verdure; and at intervals in the deep emerald is
caught the gleam from the glassy surface of a lake, of which
there are many scattered over the peninsula. All along
the northern horizon, curving away in a magnificent sweep
of forty miles to the west, rise the hoary cliffs of the Mississippi,
in the opposite state, like towers and castles; while
[17] the windings of the stream itself are betrayed by the
heavy forest-belt skirting the prairie's edge. It is not
many years since this bank of the river was perfectly naked,
with not a fringe of wood. Tracing along the bold fa&ccedil;ade
of cliffs on the opposite shore, enveloped in their misty
mantle of azure, the eye detects the embouchure of the
Illinois and of several smaller streams by the deep-cut
openings. To the left extends the prairie for seventy miles,
with an average breadth of five from the river, along
which, for most of the distance, it stretches. Here and
there in the smooth surface stands out a solitary sycamore
of enormous size, heaving aloft its gigantic limbs like a
monarch of the scene. Upward of fifty thousand acres are
here laid open to the eye at a single glance, with a soil of
exhaustless fertility and of the easiest culture.</p>

<p>The whole plain spread out at the foot of the Mamelles
bears abundant evidence of having once been submerged.
The depth of the alluvion is upward of forty feet; and
from that depth we are told that logs, leaves, coal, and a
stratum of sand and pebbles bearing marks of the attrition
of running waters, have been thrown up. Through
the middle of the prairie pass several deep canals, apparently
ancient channels of the rivers, and which now form
the bed of a long irregular lake called <i>Marais Croche</i>; there
is another lake of considerable extent called <i>Marais Temps
Clair</i>.<a name="FNanchor_170_173" id="FNanchor_170_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_173" class="fnanchor">170</a> This beautiful prairie once, then, formed a por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>tion
of that immense lake which at a remote period held
possession of the American Bottom; and at the base of
the graceful [18] Mamelles these giant rivers merrily mingled
their waters, and then rolled onward to the gulf. That
ages have since elapsed, the amazing depth of the alluvial
and vegetable mould, and the ancient monuments reposing
upon some portions of the surface, leave no room for doubt.<a name="FNanchor_171_174" id="FNanchor_171_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_174" class="fnanchor">171</a>
By heavy and continued deposites of alluvion, the vast
peninsula gradually rose up from the waters; the Missouri
was forced back to the bluff La Charbonni&egrave;re, and the
rival stream to the Piasa cliffs of Illinois.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, and the pleasant little village of St. Charles
was regarded as quite the frontier-post of civilized life; now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
it is a flourishing town, and an early stage in the traveller's
route to the Far West. Its origin, with that of most of
the early settlements in this section of the valley, is French,
and [19] some few of the peculiar characteristics of its
founders are yet retained, though hardly to the extent as
in some other villages which date back to the same era.
The ancient style of some of the buildings, the singular
costume, the quick step, the dark complexion, dark eyes
and dark hair, and the merry, fluent flow of a nondescript
idiom, are, however, at once perceived by the stranger,
and indicate a peculiar people. St. Charles was settled
in 1769, and for upward of forty years retained its original
name, <i>Les Petites Cotes</i>. For some time it was under the
Spanish government with the rest of the territory, and
from this circumstance and a variety of others its population
is made up of a heterogeneous mass of people, from
almost every nation under the sun. Quite a flood of German
emigration has, within six or seven years past, poured
into the county. That wizard spell, however, under which
all these early French settlements seem to have been lying
for more than a century, St. Charles has not, until within a few
years past, possessed the energy to throw off, though now
the inroads of American enterprise upon the ancient order
of things is too palpable to be unobserved or mistaken.
The site of the town is high and healthy, upon a bed of
limestone extending along the stream, and upon a narrow
<i>plateau</i> one or two miles in extent beneath the overhanging
bluffs. Upon this interval are laid off five streets parallel
with the river, only the first of which is lined with
buildings. Below the village the alluvion stretches along
the margin of the stream for three miles, until, reaching
the termination of the [20] highlands at the Mamelles, it
spreads itself out to the north and west into the celebrated
prairie I have described. St. Charles has long been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
great thoroughfare to the vast region west of the Missouri,
and must always continue so to be: a railroad from St.
Louis in this direction must pass through the place, as
well as the national road now in progress. These circumstances,
together with its eligible site for commerce; the
exhaustless fertility of the neighbouring region, and the
quantities of coal and iron it is believed to contain, must
render St. Charles, before many years have passed away,
a place of considerable mercantile and manufacturing importance.
It has an extensive steam flouring-mill in constant
operation; and to such an extent is the cultivation
of wheat carried on in the surrounding country, for which
the soil is pre-eminently suited, that in this respect alone
the place must become important. About six miles south
of St. Charles, upon the Booneslick road, is situated a
considerable settlement, composed chiefly of gentlemen
from the city of Baltimore.<a name="FNanchor_172_175" id="FNanchor_172_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_175" class="fnanchor">172</a> The country is exceedingly
beautiful, healthy, and fertile; the farms are under high
cultivation, and the tone of society is distinguished for its
refinement and intelligence.</p>

<p>The citizens of St. Charles are many of them Catholics;
and a male and female seminary under their patronage
are in successful operation, to say nothing of a nunnery,
beneath the shade of which such institutions invariably
repose. "St. Charles College," a Protestant institute of
two or three years' standing, is well supported, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
four professors [21] and about a hundred students.<a name="FNanchor_173_176" id="FNanchor_173_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_176" class="fnanchor">173</a> Its
principal building is a large and elegant structure of
brick, and the seminary will doubtless, ere long, become
an ornament to the place. At no distant day it may
assume the character and standing of its elder brothers
east of the Alleghanies; and the muse that ever delights to
revel in college-hall may strike her lyre even upon the banks
of the far-winding, wilderness Missouri.</p>

<p>Among the heterogeneous population of St. Charles are
still numbered a few of those wild, daring spirits, whose
lives and exploits are so intimately identified with the early
history of the country, and most of whose days are now
passed beyond the border, upon the broad buffalo-plains
at the base of the Rocky Mountains. Most of them are
trappers, hunters, <i>couriers du bois</i>, traders to the distant
post of Santa F&eacute;, or <i>engag&eacute;s</i> of the American Fur Company.
Into the company of one of these remarkable men
it was my fortune to fall during my visit at St. Charles;
and not a little to my interest and edification did he recount
many of his "hairbreadth 'scapes," his "most disastrous
chances,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His moving accidents by flood and field."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">All of this, not to mention sundry sage items on the most
approved method of capturing <i>deer</i>, <i>bar</i>, <i>buffalo</i>, and <i>painters</i>,
I must be permitted to waive. I am no tale-teller, "but
your mere traveller, believe me," as Ben Jonson has it.
The proper home of the buffalo seems now to be the vast
[22] plains south and west of the Missouri border, called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the Platte country, compared with which the prairies east
of the Mississippi are mere meadows in miniature. The
latter region was, doubtless, once a favourite resort of the
animal, and the banks of the "beautiful river" were long
his grazing-grounds; but the onward march of civilization
has driven him, with the Indian, nearer the setting sun.
Upon the plains they now inhabit they rove in herds of
thousands; they regularly migrate with change of season,
and, in crossing rivers, many are squeezed to death. Dead
bodies are sometimes found floating upon the Missouri
far down its course.</p>

<p>With the village and county of St. Charles are connected
most of the events attending the early settlement of the
region west of the Mississippi; and during the late war
with Great Britain, the atrocities of the savage tribes were
chiefly perpetrated here. Early in that conflict the Sacs
and Foxes, Miamis, Pottawattamies, Iowas, and Kickapoo
Indians commenced a most savage warfare upon the advanced
settlements, and the deeds of daring which distinguished
the gallant "rangers" during the two years in
which, unaided by government, they sustained, single-handed,
the conflict against a crafty foe, are almost unequalled
in the history of warfare.<a name="FNanchor_174_177" id="FNanchor_174_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_177" class="fnanchor">174</a> St. Charles county
and the adjoining county of Booneslick were the principal
scene of a conflict in which boldness and barbarity, courage
and cruelty, contended long for the mastery. The latter
county to which I have alluded [23] received its name from
the celebrated Daniel Boone.<a name="FNanchor_175_178" id="FNanchor_175_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_178" class="fnanchor">175</a> After being deprived, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the chicanery of law, of that spot for which he had endured
so much and contended so boldly in the beautiful land of
his adoption, we find him, at the close of the last century,
journeying onward towards the West, there to pass the
evening of his days and lay away his bones. Being asked
"<i>why</i> he had left that dear Kentucke, which he had discovered
and won from the wild Indian, for the wilderness
of Missouri," his memorable reply betrays the leading
feature of his character, the <i>primum mobile</i> of the man:
"Too crowded! too crowded! I want elbow-room!" At
the period of Boone's arrival in 1798, the only form of
government which existed in this distant region was that
of the "Regulators," a sort of military or hunters' republic,
the chief of which was styled <i>commandant</i>. To this office
the old veteran was at once elected, and continued to
exercise its rather arbitrary prerogatives until, like his
former home, the country had become subject to other
laws and other councils. He continued here to reside, however,
until the death of his much-loved wife, partner of all
his toils and adventures, in 1813, when he removed to the
residence of his son, some miles in the interior. Here
he discovered a large and productive salt-lick, long and
profitably worked, and which still continues to bear his
name and give celebrity to the surrounding country. To
this lick was the old hunter accustomed to repair in his
aged days, when his sinews were unequal to the chase,
and lie in wait for the deer [24] which frequented the spring.
In this occupation and in that of trapping beavers he lived
comfortably on until 1818, when he calmly yielded up
his adventurous spirit to its God.<a name="FNanchor_176_179" id="FNanchor_176_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_179" class="fnanchor">176</a> What an eventful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
life was that! How varied and wonderful its incidents!
How numerous and pregnant its vicissitudes! How strange
the varieties of natural character it developed! The name
of Boone will never cease to be remembered so long as
this Western Valley remains the pride of a continent, and
the beautiful streams of his discovery roll on their teeming
tribute to the ocean!</p>

<p>Of the Indian tribe which formerly inhabited this
pleasant region, and gave a name to the river and state,
scarcely a vestige is now to be seen. The only associations
connected with the savages are of barbarity and perfidy.
Upon the settlers of St. Charles county it was that Black
Hawk directed his first efforts;<a name="FNanchor_177_180" id="FNanchor_177_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_180" class="fnanchor">177</a> and, until within a few
years, a stoccade fort for refuge in emergency has existed
in every considerable settlement. Among a variety of traditionary
matter related to me relative to the customs of
the tribe which formerly resided near St. Charles, the
following anecdote from one of the oldest settlers may
not prove uninteresting.</p>

<p>"Many years ago, while the Indian yet retained a
crumbling foothold upon this pleasant land of his fathers, a
certain Cis-atlantic naturalist&mdash;so the story goes&mdash;overflowing
with laudable zeal for the advancement of science, had
succeeded in penetrating the wilds of Missouri in pursuit
of his favourite study. Early one sunny morning a man
in strange [25] attire was perceived by the simple natives
running about their prairie with uplifted face and outspread
palms, eagerly in pursuit of certain bright flies and insects,
which, when secured, were deposited with manifest satis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>faction
into a capacious tin box at his girdle. Surprised
at a spectacle so novel and extraordinary, a fleet runner
was despatched over the prairie to catch the curious animal
and conduct him into the village. A council of sober
old chiefs was called to <i>sit upon</i> the matter, who, after
listening attentively to all the phenomena of the case, with
a sufficiency of grunting, sagaciously and decidedly pronounced
the pale-face a <i>fool</i>. It was in vain the unhappy
man urged upon the assembled wisdom of the nation the
distinction between a <i>natural</i> and a naturalist. The council
grunted to all he had to offer, but to them the distinction
was without a difference; they could comprehend not a
syllable he uttered. 'Actions speak louder than words'&mdash;so
reasoned the old chiefs; and as the custom was to <i>kill</i>
all their own fools, preparation was forthwith commenced
to administer this summary cure for folly upon the unhappy
naturalist. At this critical juncture a prudent old Indian
suggested the propriety, as the fool belonged to the 'pale
faces,' of consulting their 'Great Father' at St. Louis on
the subject, and requesting his presence at the execution.
The sentence was suspended, therefore, for a few hours,
while a deputation was despatched to General Clarke,<a name="FNanchor_178_181" id="FNanchor_178_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_181" class="fnanchor">178</a>
detailing all the circumstances of the case, and announcing
the intention of killing the fool as soon as possible. [26]
The old general listened attentively to the matter, and
then quietly advised them, as the <i>fool</i> was a <i>pale face</i>,
not to kill him, but to conduct him safely to St. Louis,
that he might dispose of him himself. This proposition
was readily acceded to, as the only wish of the Indians
was to rid the world of a <i>fool</i>. And thus was the worthy
naturalist relieved from an unpleasant predicament, not,
however, without the loss of his box of bugs; a loss he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
said to have bewailed as bitterly as, in anticipation, he had
bewailed the loss of his head." For the particulars of
this anecdote I am no voucher; I give the tale as told
me; but as it doubtless has its origin in fact, it may have
suggested to the author of "The Prairie" that amusing
character, "Obed Battius, M.D.," especially as the
scene of that interesting tale lies in a neighbouring region.<a name="FNanchor_179_182" id="FNanchor_179_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_182" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>It was a sultry afternoon when I left St. Charles. The
road for some miles along the bottom runs parallel with
the river, until, ascending a slight elevation, the traveller
is on the prairie. Upon this road I had not proceeded
many miles before I came fully to the conclusion, that the
route I was then pursuing would never conduct me and
my horse to the town of Grafton, Illinois, the point of my
destination. In this idea I was soon confirmed by a half-breed
whom I chanced to meet. Receiving a few general
instructions, therefore, touching my route, all of which I
had quite forgotten ten minutes after, I pushed forth into
the pathless prairie, and was soon in its centre, almost
buried, with my horse beneath me, in the monstrous vegetation.
[27] Between the parallel rolls of the prairie, the
size of the weeds and undergrowth was stupendous; and
the vegetation heaved in masses heavily back and forth in
the wind, as if for years it had flourished on in rank, undisturbed
luxuriance. Directly before me, along the northern
horizon, rose the white cliffs of the Mississippi, which, as they
went up to the sheer height, in some places, of several
hundred feet, presented a most mountain-like aspect as
viewed over the level surface of the plain. Towards a
dim column of smoke which curled lazily upward among
these cliffs did I now direct my course. The broad disk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of the sun was rapidly wheeling down the western heavens;
my tired horse could advance through the heavy grass
no faster than a walk; the pale bluffs, apparently but a
few miles distant, seemed receding like an <i>ignis fatuus</i> as
I approached them; and there lay the swampy forest
to ford, and the "terrible Mississippi" beyond to ferry,
before I could hope for food or a resting-place. In simple
verity, I began to meditate upon the yielding character of
prairie-grass for a couch. And yet, of such surpassing
loveliness was the scene spread out around me, that I
seemed hardly to realize a situation disagreeable enough,
but from which my thoughts were constantly wandering.
The grasses and flowering wild-plants of the Mamelle
Prairie are far-famed for their exquisite brilliancy of hue
and gracefulness of form. Among the flowers my eye
detected a species unlike to any I had yet met with, and
which seemed indigenous only here. Its fairy-formed
corolla [28] was of a bright enamelled crimson, which,
in the depths of the dark herbage, glowed like a living
coal. How eloquently did this little flower bespeak the
being and attributes of its Maker. Ah!</p>

<p>One who has never looked upon the Western prairie
in the pride of its blushing bloom can hardly conceive the
surpassing loveliness of its summer flora; and, if the idea
is not easy to conceive, still less is it so to convey. The
autumn flowers in their richness I have not yet beheld; and
in the early days of June, when I first stood upon the
prairies, the beauteous sisterhood of spring were all in their
graves; and the sweet springtime of the year it is when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
gentle race of flowers dance over the teeming earth in gayest
guise and profusion. In the first soft days of April, when
the tender green of vegetation begins to overspread the
soil scathed by the fires of autumn, the <i>viola</i>, primrose of
the prairie, in all its rare and delicate forms; the <i>anemone</i>
or wind-flower; the blue dewy harebell; the pale oxlip; the
flowering <i>arbute</i>, and all the pretty family of the pinks and
lilies lie sprinkled, as by the enchantment of a summer
shower, or by the tripping footsteps of Titania with her
fairies, over the landscape. The blue and the white then
tint the perspective, from the most [29] limpid cerulean of
an <i>iris</i> to the deep purple of the pink; from the pearly lustre
of the cowslip to the golden richness of the buttercup.
In early springtime, too, the island groves of the prairies
are also in flower; and the brilliant crimson of the <i>cercis
canadensis</i>, or Judas-tree; the delightful fragrance of
the <i>lonicera</i> or honeysuckle, and the light yellow of the
<i>jasimum</i>, render the forests as pleasant to the smell as to
the eye. But spring-time passes away, and with her pass
away the fair young flowers her soft breath had warmed
into being. Summer comes over the prairies like a giant;
the fiery dog-star rages, and forth leap a host of bright
ones to greet his coming. The <i>heliotrope</i> and <i>helianthus</i>,
in all their rich variety; the wild rose, flinging itself around
the shrub-oak like a wreath of rainbows; the <i>orchis</i>, the
balmy thyme, the burgamot, and the asters of every tint
and proportion, then prevail, throwing forth their gaudy,
sunburnt petals upon the wind, until the whole meadow
seems arrayed in the royal livery of a sunset sky. Scarcely
does the summer begin to decline, and autumn's golden
sunlight to stream in misty magnificence athwart the landscape,
than a thousand gorgeous plants of its own mellow
hue are nodding in stately beauty over the plain. Yellow
is the garniture of the autumnal Flora of the prairies; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
the haughty golden-rod, and all the splendid forms of the
<i>gentiana</i>, commingling with the white and crimson <i>eupatorium</i>,
and the red spire of the <i>liatris</i>, everywhere bespangle
the scene; while the trumpet-formed corolla of the <i>bignonia
radicans</i> glitters [30] in the sunbeams, amid the luxuriant
wreathing of ivy, from the tall capitals of the isolated trees.
All the <i>solidago</i> species are in their glory, and every variety
of the <i>lobelia</i>; and the blood-red sumach in the hollows
and brakes, and the <i>sagittaria</i>, or arrow-head, with its
three-leaved calyx and its three white petals darting forth
from the recesses of the dark herbage, and all the splendid
forms of the aquatic plants, with their broad blossoms
and their cool scroll-like leaves, lend a finished richness
of hue to the landscape, which fails not well to harmonize
with the rainbow glow of the distant forest.</p>

<p class="noidt">What wonder, then, that, amid a scene like this, where the
summer reigned, and young autumn was beginning to anticipate
its mellow glories, the traveller should in a measure
have forgotten his vocation, and loitered lazily along his
way!</p>

<p>There is one feature of the Mamelle Prairie, besides
its eminent beauty and its profusion of flowering plants,
which distinguishes it from every other with which I have
met. I allude to the almost perfect uniformity of its
surface. There is little of that undulating, wavelike slope
and swell which characterizes the peculiar species of surface
called prairie. With the exception of a few lakes,
abounding with aquatic plants and birds, and those broad
furrows traversing the plain, apparently ancient beds of
the rivers, the surface appears smooth as a lawn. This
circumstance goes far to corroborate the idea of alluvial
origin. And thus it was that, lost in a mazy labyrinth
of grass and flowers, I wandered on over the smooth soil
of the prairie, quite regardless of the whereabout my steps
were conducting me. The sun was just going down when
my horse entered a slight footpath leading into a point of
woodland upon [32] the right. This I pursued for some
time, heedlessly presuming that it would conduct me to
the banks of the river; when, lo! to my surprise, on emerging
from the forest, I found myself in the midst of a French
village, with its heavy roofs and broad piazzas. Never
was the lazy hero of Diedrich Knickerbocker&mdash;luckless
Rip&mdash;more sadly bewildered, after a twenty years' doze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
among the Hudson Highlands, than was your loiterer at
this unlooked-for apparition. To find one's self suddenly
translated from the wild, flowery prairie into the heart of
an aged, moss-grown village, of such foreign aspect, withal,
was by no means easy to reconcile with one's notions of
reality. Of the name, or even the existence of the village,
I had been quite as ignorant as if it had never possessed
either; and in vain was it that I essayed, in my perplexity,
to make myself familiar with these interesting items of
intelligence by inquiry of the primitive-looking beings whom
I chanced to encounter, as I rode slowly on into the village
through the tall stoccades of the narrow streets. Every
one stared as I addressed him; but, shaking his head and
quickening his pace, pointed me on in the direction I was
proceeding, and left me to pursue it in ignorance and single
blessedness. This mystery&mdash;for thus to my excited fancy
did it seem&mdash;became at length intolerable. Drawing up
my horse before the open door of a cottage, around which,
beneath the galleries, were gathered a number of young
people of both sexes, I very peremptorily made the demand
<i>where I was</i>. All stared, and some few took it upon them,
graceless youths, to [33] laugh; until, at length, a dark
young fellow, with black eyes and black whiskers, stepped
forward, and, in reply to my inquiry repeated, informed me
that the village was called "<i>Portage des Sioux</i>;" that the
place of my destination was upon the opposite bank of the
Mississippi, several miles above&mdash;too distant to think of
regaining my route at that late hour; and very politely the
dark young man offered to procure for me accommodation
for the night, though the village could boast no inn. Keeping
close on the heels of my <i>conducteur</i>, I again began to
thrid the narrow lanes of the hamlet, from the doors and
windows of every cottage of which peeped forth an eager
group of dark-eyed women and children, in uncontrolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
curiosity at the apparition of a stranger in their streets at
such an advanced hour of the day. The little village seemed
completely cut off from all the world beside, and as totally
unconscious of the proceedings of the community around
as if it were a portion of another hemisphere. The place
lies buried in forest except upon the south, where it looks
out upon the Mamelle Prairie, and to the north is an opening
in the belt of woods along the river-bank, through
which, beyond the stream, rise the white cliffs in points
and pinnacles like the towers and turrets of a castellated
town, to the perpendicular altitude of several hundred feet.
The scene was one of romantic beauty, as the moonbeams
silvered the forest-tops and cliffs, flinging their broad
shadows athwart the bosom of the waters, gliding in oily
rippling at their base. The site of Portage des Sioux is
about seven miles above [34] the town of Alton, and five
below the embouchure of the Illinois. Its landing is good; it
contains three or four hundred inhabitants, chiefly French;
can boast a few trading establishments, and, as is invariably
the case in the villages of this singular people, however
inconsiderable, has an ancient Catholic church rearing
its gray spire above the low-roofed cottages. Attached to
it, also, is a "common field" of twelve hundred <i>arpens</i>&mdash;something
less than as many acres&mdash;stretching out into
the prairie. The soil is, of course, incomparably fertile.
The garden-plats around each door were dark with vegetation,
overtopping the pickets of the enclosures; and
away to the south into the prairie swept the broad maize-fields
nodding and rustling in all the gorgeous garniture of
summer.</p>

<p>My <i>conducteur</i> stopped, at length, at the gate of a small
brick tenement, the only one in the village, whose modern
air contrasted strangely enough with the venerable aspect
of everything else; and having made known my necessities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
through the medium of sundry Babel gibberings and gesticulations,
he left me with the promise to call early in the
morning and see me on my way.</p>

<p>"What's your <i>name</i>, any how?" was the courteous salutation
of mine host, as I placed my foot across his threshold,
after attending to the necessities of the faithful animal which
had been my companion through the fatigues of the day.
He was a dark-browed, swarthy-looking man, with exceedingly
black hair, and an eye which one might have suspected
of Indian origin but for the genuine cunning [35]&mdash;the
"lurking devil"&mdash;of its expression. Replying to the unceremonious
interrogatory with a smile, which by no means
modified the haughty moroseness of my landlord's visage,
another equally civil query was proposed, to which I received
the hurried reply, "Jean Paul de &mdash;." From
this <i>amiable</i> personage I learned, by dint of questioning,
that the village of Portage des Sioux had been standing
about half a century: that it was originally settled by a
colony from Cahokia: that its importance now was as considerable
as it ever had been: that it was terribly shaken
in the great earthquakes of 1811, many of the old cottages
having been thrown down and his own house rent from
"turret to foundation-stone"&mdash;the chasm in the brick wall
yet remaining&mdash;and, finally, that the village owed its name
to the stratagem of a band of Sioux Indians, in an expedition
against the Missouris. The legend is as follows:
"The Sioux being at war with a tribe of the Missouris, a
party descended the Upper Mississippi on an expedition
for pillage. The Missouris, apprized of their approach,
laid in ambush in the woods at the mouth of the river,
intending to take their enemies by surprise as their canoes
doubled the point to ascend. The Sioux, in the depths
of Indian subtlety, apprehending such a man&#339;uvre, instead
of descending to the confluence, landed at the port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>age,
took their canoes upon their backs, and crossed the
prairie to the Indian village on the Missouri, several miles
above. By this stratagem the design of their expedition
was accomplished, and they had returned to their canoes
in safety with their plunder long [36] before the Missouris,
who were anxiously awaiting them at their ambuscade,
were aware of their first approach."</p>

<p>Supper was soon served up, prepared in the neatest
French fashion. While at table a circumstance transpired
which afforded me some little diversion. Several of the
villagers dropped in during the progress of the meal, who,
having seated themselves at the board, a spirited colloquy
ensued in the <i>patois</i> of these old hamlets&mdash;a species of
<i>gumbo-French</i>, which a genuine native of <i>La Belle France</i>
would probably manage to unravel quite as well as a
Northern Yankee. From a few expressions, however,
the meaning of which were obvious, together with sundry
furtive glances to the eye, and divers confused withdrawals
of the gaze, it was not very difficult to detect some pretty
free remarks upon the stranger-guest. All this was suffered
to pass with undisturbed <i>nonchalance</i>, until the meal was
concluded; when the hitherto mute traveller, turning to
the negro attendant, demanded in familiar French a glass
of water. <i>Presto!</i> the effect was electric. Such visages
of ludicrous distress! such stealthy glancing of dark eyes!
such glowing of sallow cheeks! The swarthy landlord at
length hurriedly ejaculated, "<i>Parlez vous Fran&ccedil;ais?</i>" while
the dark-haired hostess could only falter "<i>Pardonnez moi!</i>"
A hearty laugh on my own part served rather to increase
than diminish the <i>empressement</i>, as it confirmed the suspicion
that their guest had realized to the full extent their
hospitable remarks. Rising from the table to put an end
to rather an awkward [37] scene, I took my <i>portfeuille</i> and
seated myself in the gallery to sketch the events of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
day. But the dark landlord looked with no favouring
eye upon the proceeding; and, as he was by no means
the man to stand for ceremony, he presently let drop a
civil hint of the propriety of <i>retiring</i>; the propriety of
complying with which civil hint was at once perceived,
early as was the hour; and soon the whole house and
village was buried in slumber. And then "the stranger
within their gates" rose quietly from his couch, and in a
few moments was luxuriating in the fresh night-wind, laden
with perfumes from the flowerets of the prairie it swept.
And beautifully was the wan moonlight playing over forest,
and prairie, and rustling maize-field, and over the gray
church spire, and the old village in its slumbering. And
the giant cliffs rose white and ghastly beyond the dark
waters of the endless river, as it rolled on in calm magnificence,
"for ever flowing and the same for ever." And
associations of the scene with other times and other men
thronged "thick and fast" upon the fancy.</p>

<p>The first vermeil flush of morning was firing the eastern
forest-tops, when a single horseman was to be seen issuing
from the narrow lanes of the ancient village of Portage
des Sioux, whose inhabitants had not yet shaken off the
drowsiness of slumber, and winding slowly along beneath
the huge trees skirting the prairie's margin. After an hour
of irregular wandering through the heavy meadow-grass,
drenched and dripping in the dews, and glistening in the
morning sunlight, he plunges into the [38] old woods on
his right, and in a few moments stands beneath the vine-clad
sycamores, with the brilliant, trumpet-formed flower
of the <i>bignonia</i> suspended from the branches upon the
margin of a stream. It is the "Father of Waters," and
beyond its bounding bosom lies the little hamlet of Grafton,
slumbering in quiet beauty beneath the cliffs. The scene
is a lovely one: the mighty river rolling calmly and majes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>tically
on&mdash;the moss-tasselled forest upon its bank&mdash;the
isles of brightness around which it ripples&mdash;the craggy
precipice, rearing its bald, broad forehead beyond&mdash;the
smoking cottages at the base, and the balmy breath of
morning, with fragrance curling the blue waters, are outlines
of a portraiture which imagination alone can fill up.</p>

<p>Blast after blast from the throat of a huge horn suspended
from the limb of an aged cotton-wood, went pealing over
the waters; but all the echoes in the surrounding forest
had been awakened, and an hour was gone by, before a
float, propelled by the sturdy sinews of a single brace of
arms, had obeyed the summons. And so the traveller sat
himself quietly down upon the bank beneath the tree-shade,
and luxuriated on the feast of natural scenery spread out
before him.</p>

<p>The site of the town of Grafton is an elevated strip of
bottom-land, stretching along beneath the bluffs, and in
this respect somewhat resembling Alton, fifteen or twenty
miles below. The <i>locale</i> of the village is, however, far
more delightful than that of its neighbour, whatever the
relative advantages for commerce they may boast, though
those of the [39] former are neither few nor small. Situated
at the <i>mouth</i> of the Illinois as to navigation; possessing
an excellent landing for steamers, an extensive and
fertile interior, rapidly populating, and inexhaustible
quarries for the builder, the town, though recently laid off,
is going on in the march of improvement; and, with an
hundred other villages of the West, bids fair to become a
nucleus of wealth and commerce.</p>

<p>On the morning of my arrival at Grafton, while my
brisk little hostess was making ready for my necessities,
I stepped out to survey the place, and availed myself of
an hour of leisure to visit a somewhat remarkable cavern
among the cliffs, a little below the village, the entrance of
which had caught my attention while awaiting the movements
of the ferryman on the opposite bank of the Mississippi.
It is approached by a rough footpath along the
[40] river-margin, piled up with huge masses of limestone,
which have been toppled from the beetling crags above:
these, at this point, as before stated, are some hundred feet
in perpendicular height. The orifice of the cave is elliptical
in outline, and somewhat regular, being an excavation by
the whirling of waters apparently in the surface of the
smooth escarpment; it is about twenty feet in altitude, and
as many in width. Passing the threshold of the entrance,
an immediate expansion takes place into a spacious apartment
some forty or fifty feet in depth, and about the same
in extreme height: nearly in the centre a huge perpendicular
column of solid rock rears itself from the floor to the
roof. From this point the cavern lengthens itself away
into a series of apartments to the distance of several
hundred feet, with two lesser entrances in the same line
with that in the middle, and at regular intervals. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
walls of the cave, like everything of a geological character
in this region, are composed of a secondary limestone,
abounding in testaceous fossils. The spot exhibits conclusive
evidence of having once been subject to diluvial
action; and the cavern itself, as I have observed, seems
little else than an excavation from the heart of an enormous
mass of marine petrifaction. Large quantities of human
bones of all sizes have been found in this cavern, leaving
little doubt that, by the former dwellers in this fair land,
the spot was employed as a catacomb. I myself picked
up the <i>sincipital</i> section of a scull, which would have
ecstasied a virtuoso beyond measure; and [41] several of
the <i>lumbar vertebr&aelig;</i>, which, if they prove nothing else,
abundantly demonstrate the aboriginal natives of North
America to have been no pigmy race. The spot is now
desecrated by the presence of a party of sturdy coopers,
who could not, however, have chosen a more delightful
apartment for their handicraft; rather more taste than
piety, however, has been betrayed in the selection. The
view of the water and the opposite forest from the elevated
mouth of the cavern is very fine, and three or four broad-leafed
sycamores fling over the whole a delightful shade.
The waters of the river flow onward in a deep current at
the base, and the fish throw themselves into the warm sunlight
from the surface. What a charming retreat from the
fiery fervour of a midsummer noon!</p>

<p>The heavy bluffs which overhang the village, and over
which winds the great road to the north, though not a little
wearisome to surmount, command from the summit a vast
and beautiful landscape. A series of inclined planes are
talked of by the worthy people of Grafton to overcome
these bluffs, and render their village less difficult of inland
ingress and regress; and though the idea is not a little
amusing, of rail-cars running off at an angle of forty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
degrees, yet when we consider that this place, if it ever
becomes of <i>any</i> importance, must become a grand thoroughfare
and d&eacute;p&ocirc;t on the route from St. Louis and the agricultural
regions of the Missouri to the northern counties
of Illinois, the design seems less chimerical <i>than it might
be</i>. A charter, indeed, for a railroad [42] from Grafton,
through Carrolton to Springfield, has been obtained, a
company organized, and a portion of the stock subscribed;<a name="FNanchor_180_183" id="FNanchor_180_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_183" class="fnanchor">180</a>
while another corporation is to erect a splendid hotel. The
traveller over the bluffs, long before he stands upon their
summit, heartily covets any species of locomotion other
than the back of a quadruped. But the scenery, as he ascends,
caught at glimpses through the forest, is increasingly
beautiful. Upon one of the loftiest eminences to the right
stand the ruins of a huge stone-heap; the tumulus, perchance,
of some red-browed chieftain of other days. It
was a beautiful custom of these simple-hearted sons of the
wilderness to lay away the relics of their loved and honoured
ones even upon the loftiest, greenest spots of the
whole earth; where the freed spirit might often rise to look
abroad over the glories of that pleasant forest-home where
once it roved in the chase or bounded forth upon the path
of war. And it is a circumstance not a little worthy of
notice, that veneration for the dead is a feeling universally
betrayed by uncivilized nations. The Indian widow of
Florida annually despoils herself of her luxuriant tresses to
wreathe the headstone beneath which reposes the bones of
her husband. The Canadian mother, when her infant is torn
from her bosom by the chill hand of death, and, with a
heart almost breaking, she has been forced to lay him away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
beneath the sod, is said, in the touching intensity of her
affection, to bathe the tombstone of her little one with that
genial flood which Nature poured through her veins for
his nourishment [43] while living. The Oriental nations,
it is well known, whether civilized or savage, have ever,
from deepest antiquity, manifested an eloquent solicitude
for the sepulchres of their dead. The expiring Israelite,
we are always told, "was gathered to his fathers;" and
the tombs of the Jewish monarchs, some of which exist even
to the present day, were gorgeously magnificent. The
nations of modern Turkey and India wreathe the tombs
of their departed friends with the gayest and most beautiful
flowers of the season; while the very atmosphere around
is refreshed by fountains.</p>

<p>From the site of the stone-heap of which I have spoken,
and which may or may <i>not</i> have been erected to the memory
of some Indian chieftain, a glorious cosmorama of the
whole adjacent region, miles in circumference, is unfolded
to the eye. At your feet, far below, flow on the checkered
waters of the Mississippi, gliding in ripples among their
emerald islands; while at intervals, as the broad stream
comes winding on from the west, is caught the flashing
sheen of its surface through the dense old woods that fringe
its margin. Beyond these, to the south, lies spread the
broad and beautiful Mamelle Prairie, even to its faint blue
blending with the distant horizon laid open to the eye,
rolling and heaving its heavy herbage in the breeze to the
sunlight like the long wave of ocean. And the bright green
island-groves, the cape-like forest-strips swelling out upon
its bosom, the flashing surface of lakes and water-sheets,
almost buried in the luxuriance of vegetation, with thousands
of [44] aquatic birds wheeling their broad flight over
them, all contribute to fill up the lineaments of a scene of
beauty which fails not to enrapture the spectator. Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and then along the smooth meadow, a darker luxuriance
of verdure, with the curling cabin-smoke upon its border,
and vast herds of domestic cattle in its neighbourhood,
betray the presence of man, blending <i>his</i> works with the
wild and beautiful creations of Nature. On the right, at
a distance of two miles, come in the placid waters of the
Illinois, from the magnificent bluffs in the back-ground
stealing softly and quietly into the great river through the
wooded islands at its mouth. The day was a sultry one;
the atmosphere was like the breath of a furnace; but
over the heights of the bluffs swept the morning air,
fresh and cool from the distant prairie. For some miles,
as is invariably the case upon the banks of the Western
rivers, the road winds along among bluffs and sink-holes;
and so constantly does its course vary and diverge, that
a pocket compass is anything but a needless appendage.
Indeed, all his calculations to the contrary notwithstanding,
the traveller throughout the whole of this region describes
with his route a complete Virginia fence. The road is
not a little celebrated for its tortuosity. At length the
traveller emerges upon a prairie. On its edge beneath
the forest stands a considerable settlement, bordering on
Macoupin Creek, from which it takes a name. In the
latter part of 1816 this settlement was commenced, and was
then the most northern location of whites in the Territory
of Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_181_184" id="FNanchor_181_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_184" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>[45] It was evening, at the close of a sultry day, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
village of Carrolton appeared before me among the trees.<a name="FNanchor_182_185" id="FNanchor_182_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_185" class="fnanchor">182</a>
I was struck with the quiet air of simple elegance which
seemed to pervade the place, though its general outlines
are those of every other Western village I have visited.
One broad, regular street extends through the town, upon
either side of which stand the stores and better class of
private residences; while in the back-ground, scattered
promiscuously along the transverse avenues, are log-cabins
surrounded by cornfields, much like those in the villages
of the French. Three sides of the town are bounded by
forest, while the fourth opens upon the prairie called
"String Prairie." In the centre of the village, upon the
principal street, is reserved a square, in the middle of which
stands the courthouse, with other public structures adjacent,
and the stores and hotels along its sides. One thing in Carrolton
which struck me as a little singular, was the unusual
diversity of religious denominations. Of these there are
not less than five or six; three of which have churches,
and a fourth is setting itself in order to build; and all this
in a village of hardly one thousand inhabitants. The
courthouse is a handsome edifice of brick, two stories, with
a neat spire. The neighbouring region is fertile and
healthy; well proportioned with prairie and timber, well
watered by the Macoupin and Apple Creeks,<a name="FNanchor_183_186" id="FNanchor_183_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_186" class="fnanchor">183</a> and well
populated by a sturdy, thriving race of yeomanry. This
is, indeed, strictly an agricultural village; and, so far as my
own observation [46] extended, little attention is paid or
taste manifested for anything else.</p>

<p>About a dozen miles north of Carrolton is situated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
village of Whitehall, a flourishing settlement in the prairie's
edge, from the centre of which, some miles distant, it may
be seen.<a name="FNanchor_184_187" id="FNanchor_184_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_187" class="fnanchor">184</a> Three years ago the spot was an uncultivated
waste; the town has now two houses of worship, a school,
an incorporation for a seminary, two taverns, six hundred
inhabitants, and a steam mill to feed them withal. A
few miles from this place, on the outskirts of another small
settlement, I was met by a company of emigrants from
Western New-York. The women and children were piled
upon the top of the household stuff with about as much
ceremony as if they constituted a portion thereof, in a
huge lumbering baggage-wagon, around which dangled
suspended pots and kettles, dutch-ovens and tin-kitchens,
cheese-roasters and bread-toasters, all in admired confusion,
jangling harsh discord. The cart-wheels themselves,
as they gyrated upon the parched axles, like the
gates of Milton's hell on their hinges, "grated harsh
thunder." In the van of the cavalcade strode soberly on
the patriarch of the family, with his elder sons, axe upon
shoulder, rifle in hand, a veritable Israel Bush. For six
weeks had the wanderers been travelling, and a weary,
bedusted-looking race were they, that emigrant family.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which a Western village goes forward,
and begins to assume importance among the nations, after
having once been born and [47] christened, is amazing.
The mushrooms of a summer's night, the wondrous gourd
of Jonah, the astonishing bean of the giant-killer, or the
enchantments of the Arabian Nights, are but fit parallels
to the growth of the prairie-village of the Far West. Of
all this I was forcibly reminded in passing through quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
a town upon my route named Manchester, where I dined,
and which, if my worthy landlord was not incorrect, two
years before could hardly boast a log-cabin.<a name="FNanchor_185_188" id="FNanchor_185_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_188" class="fnanchor">185</a> It is now a
thriving place, on the northern border of Mark's Prairie,
from which it may be seen four or five miles before entering
its streets; it is surrounded by a body of excellent timber,
always the <i>magnum desideratum</i> in Illinois. This scarcity
of timber will not, however, be deemed such an insurmountable
obstacle to a dense and early population of this state as
may have been apprehended, when we consider the unexampled
rapidity with which a young growth pushes itself
forward into the prairies when once protected from the
devastating effects of the autumnal fires; the exhaustless
masses of bituminous coal which may be thrown up from
the ravines, and creeks, and bluffs of nearly every county
in the state; the facility of ditching, by the assistance of
blue grass to bind the friable soil, and the luxuriance of
hedge-rows for enclosures, as practised almost solely in
England, France, and the Netherlands; and, finally, the
convenience of manufacturing brick for all the purposes
of building. There is not, probably, any quarter of the
state destined to become more populous and powerful [48]
than that section of Morgan county through which I was
now passing. On every side, wherever the traveller turns
his eye, beautiful farms unfold their broad, wavy prairie-fields
of maize and wheat, indicative of affluence and prosperity.
The <i>worst</i> soil of the prairies is best adapted to
wheat; it is <i>generally</i> too fertile; the growth too rapid and
luxuriant; the stalk so tall and the ear so heavy, that it
is lodged before matured for the sickle. Illinois, consequently,
can never become a celebrated wheat region,
though for corn and coarser grains it is now unequalled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>The rapidity with which this state has been peopled is
wonderful, especially its northern counties. In the year
1821, that section of country embraced within the present
limits of Morgan county numbered but twenty families;
in 1830 its population was nearly fourteen thousand, and
cannot now be estimated at less than seventeen thousand!
Many of the settlers are natives of the New-England States;
and with them have brought those habits of industrious
sobriety for which the North has ever been distinguished.
In all the enterprise of the age, professing for its object
the amelioration of human condition and the advancement
of civilization, religion, and the arts, Morgan county stands
in advance of all others in the state. What a wonderful
revolution have a few fleeting years of active enterprise
induced throughout a region once luxuriating in all the
savageness of nature; while the wild prairie-rose "blushed
unseen," and the wilder forest-son pursued the deer!
Fair villages, [49] like spring violets along the meadow,
have leaped forth into being, to bless and to gladden
the land, and to render even this beautiful portion of God's
beautiful world&mdash;though for ages a profitless waste&mdash;at
length the abode of intelligence, virtue, and peace.</p>

<p>It was near the close of the day that the extent and
frequency of the farms on either side, the more finished
structure of the houses, the regularity of enclosures, the
multitude of vehicles of every description by which I was
encountered, and the dusty, hoof-beaten thoroughfare over
which I was travelling, all reminded me that I was
drawing nigh to Jacksonville, the principal town in Illinois.
Passing "Diamond Grove," a beautiful forest-island
of nearly a thousand acres, elevated above the surrounding
prairie to which it gives a name,<a name="FNanchor_186_189" id="FNanchor_186_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_189" class="fnanchor">186</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
environed by flourishing farms, the traveller catches a
view of the distant village stretching away along the northern
horizon. He soon enters an extended avenue, perfectly
uniform for several miles, leading on to the town. Beautiful
meadows and harvest-fields on either side sweep off
beyond the reach of the eye, their neat white cottages and
palings peeping through the enamelled foliage. To the
left, upon a swelling upland at the distance of some miles,
are beheld the brick edifices of "Illinois College," relieved
by a dark grove of oaks resting against the western sky.<a name="FNanchor_187_190" id="FNanchor_187_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_190" class="fnanchor">187</a>
These large buildings, together with the numerous other
public structures, imposingly situated and strongly relieved,
give to the place a dignified, city-like aspect in distant
[50] view. After a ride of more than a mile within the
immediate suburbs of the town, the traveller ascends
a slight elevation, and the next moment finds himself in
the public square, surrounded on every side by stores and
dwellings, carts and carriages, market-people, horses, and
hotels.</p>

<p>It was a remark of that celebrated British statesman,
Horace Walpole, that the vicissitudes of no man's life were
too slight to prove interesting, if detailed in the simple order
of their occurrence. The idea originated with the poet
Gray, if an idea which has suggested itself to the mind of
every man may be appropriated by an individual. Assuming
the sentiment as true, the author of these <span class="smcap">sketches</span>
has alone presumed to lay his observations and adventures
as a traveller before the <i>majesty of the public</i>; and upon
this principle <i>solely</i> must they rely for any interest they
may [51] claim. A mere glance at those which have preceded
must convince the reader that their object has been
by no means exact geographical and statistical information.
Errors and omissions have, doubtless, often occurred in
the hasty view which has been taken: partially through
negligence, sometimes through lack of knowledge, misinformation,
or attempt at brevity, but never through aforethought
or malice prepense. Upon the whole, the writer
admits himself completely laid open to criticism; and,
should any public-spirited worthy deem it his duty to rise
up in judgment and avenge the wrongs of literature and
the community, he has undoubted right so to do: nathless,
he is most veritably forewarned that he will hardly gather
up his "labour for his pains!" But <i>allons</i>.</p>

<p>It is only ten or twelve years since the town site of Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>sonville,
now, perhaps, the most flourishing inland village
in Illinois, was first <i>laid off</i>; and it is but within the past
five years that its present unprecedented advancement can
be dated.<a name="FNanchor_188_191" id="FNanchor_188_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_191" class="fnanchor">188</a> Its site is a broad elevated roll in the midst
of a beautiful prairie; and, from whatever point it is approached,
few places present a more delightful prospect.
The spot seems marked and noted by Nature for the abode
of man. The neighbouring prairie is undulating, and the
soil uncommonly rich, even in this land of fertility. It is
mostly under high cultivation, and upon its northern and
western edge is environed by pleasant groves, watered by
many a "sweet and curious brook." The public square
in the centre of the town is of noble dimensions, [52] occupied
by a handsome courthouse and a market, both of
brick, and its sides filled up with dwelling-houses, stores,
law-offices, a church, bank, and hotel. From this point
radiate streets and avenues in all directions: one through
each side of every angle near its vertex, and one through
the middle of every side; so that the town-plat is completely
cut up into rectangles. If I mistake not in my description,
it will be perceived that the public square of Jacksonville
may be entered at no less than twelve distinct avenues.
In addition to the spacious courthouse, the public buildings
consist of three or four churches. One of these, belonging
to the Congregational order, betrays much correct
taste; and its pulpit is the most simply elegant I remember
ever to have seen. It consists merely of a broad platform
in the chancel of the building, richly carpeted; a dark
mahogany bar without drapery, highly polished; and a
neat sofa of the same material in a plain back-ground.
The outline and proportion are perfect; and, like the doc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>trines
of the sect which worships here, there is an air of
severe, dignified elegance about the whole structure, pleasing
as it is rare. The number of Congregational churches
in the West is exceedingly small; and as it is always pleasant
for the stranger in a strange land to meet the peculiarities
of that worship to which from childhood-days he has
been attached, so it is peculiarly grateful to the New-England
emigrant to recognise in this distant spot the simple
faith and ceremony of the Pilgrims. Jacksonville is largely
made up of emigrants from [53] the North; and they have
brought with them many of their customs and peculiarities.
The State of Illinois may, indeed, be truly considered the
New-England of the West. In many respects it is more
congenial than any other to the character and prejudices
of the Northern emigrant. It is not a slave state; internal
improvement is the grand feature of its civil polity; and
measures for the universal diffusion of intellectual, moral,
and religious culture are in active progression. In Henry
county, in the northern section of the state, two town-plats
have within the past year been laid off for colonies
of emigrants from Connecticut, which intend removing
in the ensuing fall, accompanied each by their minister,
physician, lawyer, and with all the various artisans of
mechanical labour necessary for such communities. The
settlements are to be called Wethersfield and Andover.<a name="FNanchor_189_192" id="FNanchor_189_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_192" class="fnanchor">189</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Active measures for securing the blessings of education,
religion, temperance, etc., have already been taken.<a name="FNanchor_190_193" id="FNanchor_190_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_193" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>The edifices of "Illinois College," to which I have before
alluded, are situated upon a beautiful eminence one
mile west of the village, formerly known as "Wilson's
Grove." The site is truly delightful. In the rear lies a
dense green clump of oaks, and in front is spread out the
village, with a boundless extent of prairie beyond, covered
for miles with cultivation. Away to the south, the wildflower
flashes as gayly in the sunlight, and [54] waves as
gracefully when swept by the breeze, as centuries ago,
when no eye of man looked upon its loveliness. During
my stay at Jacksonville I visited several times this pleasant
spot, and always with renewed delight at the glorious
scenery it presented. Connected with the college buildings
are extensive grounds; and students, at their option, may
devote a portion of each day to manual labour in the
workshop or on the farm. Some individuals have, it is said,
in this manner defrayed all the expenses of their education.
This system of instruction cannot be too highly recommended.
Apart from the benefits derived in acquiring a
knowledge of the use of mechanical instruments, and the
development of mechanical genius, there are others of a
higher nature which every one who has been educated at
a public institution will appreciate. Who has not gazed
with anguish on the sunken cheek and the emaciated frame
of the young aspirant for literary distinction? Who has
not beheld the funeral fires of intellect while the lamp of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
life was fading, flaming yet more beautifully forth, only to
be dimmed for ever! The lyre is soon to be crushed; but,
ere its hour is come, it flings forth notes of melody sweet
beyond expression! Who does not know that protracted,
unremitting intellectual labour is <i>always</i> fatal, unaccompanied
by corresponding physical exertion; and who cannot
perceive that <i>any</i> inducement, be it what it may, which can
draw forth the student from his retirement, is invaluable.
Such an inducement is the lively interest which the cultivated
mind [55] always manifests in the operations of
mechanical art.</p>

<p>Illinois College has been founded but five or six years,
yet it is now one of the most flourishing institutions west
of the mountains. The library consists of nearly two
thousand volumes, and its chymical apparatus is sufficient.
The faculty are five in number, and its first class was graduated
two years since. No one can doubt the vast influence
this seminary is destined to exert, not only upon this beautiful
region of country and this state, but over the whole
great Western Valley. It owes its origin to the noble enterprise
of seven young men, graduates of Yale College, whose
names another age will enrol among our Harvards and
our Bowdoins, our Holworthys, Elliots, and Gores, great
and venerable as those names are. And, surely, we cannot
but believe that "some divinity has shaped their ends,"
when we consider the character of the spot upon which a
wise Providence has been pleased to succeed their design.
From the Northern lakes to the gulf, where may a more
eligible site be designated for an institution whose influence
shall be wide, and powerful, and salutary, than that same
beautiful grove, in that pleasant village of Jacksonville.</p>

<p>To the left of the college buildings is situated the lordly
residence of Governor Duncan, surrounded by its extensive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
grounds.<a name="FNanchor_191_194" id="FNanchor_191_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_194" class="fnanchor">191</a> There are other fine edifices scattered here
and there upon the eminence, among which the beautiful
little cottage of Mr. C., brother to the great orator of the
[56] West, holds a conspicuous station.<a name="FNanchor_192_195" id="FNanchor_192_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_195" class="fnanchor">192</a> Society in Jacksonville
is said to be superior to any in the state. It is of
a cast decidedly moral, and possesses much literary taste.
This is betrayed in the number of its schools and churches;
its lyceum, circulating library, and periodicals. In fine,
there are few spots in the West, and none in Illinois, which
to the <i>Northern</i> emigrant present stronger attractions than
the town of Jacksonville and its vicinity. Located in the
heart of a tract of country the most fertile and beautiful
in the state; swept by the sweet breath of health throughout
the year; tilled by a race of enterprising, intelligent,
hardy yeomen; possessing a moral, refined, and enlightened
society, the tired wanderer may here find his necessities
relieved and his peculiarities respected: he may here
find congeniality of feeling and sympathy of heart. And
when his memory wanders, as it sometimes must, with
melancholy musings, mayhap, over the loved scenes of
his own distant New-England, it will be sweet to realize
that, though he sees not, indeed, around him the beautiful
romance of his native hills, yet many a kindly heart
is throbbing near, whose emotions, like his own, were
nurtured in their rugged bosom. "<i>C&aelig;lum non animum
mutatur.</i>" And is it indeed true, as they often tell us, that
New-England character, like her own ungenial clime, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
cold, penurious, and heartless; while to her brethren, from
whom she is separated only by an imaginary boundary,
may be ascribed all that is lofty, and honourable, and
chivalrous in man! This is an old [57] calumny, the
offspring of prejudice and ignorance, and it were time
it were at rest. But it is not for me to contrast the leading
features of Northern character with those of the South,
or to repel the aspersions which have been heaped upon
either. Yet, reader, believe them not; many are false as
ever stained the poisoned lip of slander.</p>

<p>It was Saturday evening when I reached the village of
Jacksonville, and on the following Sabbath I listened to
the sage instruction of that eccentric preacher, but venerable
old man, Dr. P. of Philadelphia, since deceased, but
then casually present. "<i>The Young Men of the West</i>"
was a subject which had been presented him for discourse,
and worthily was it elaborated. The good people of this
little town, in more features than one, present a faithful
transcript of New-England; but in none do they betray
their Pilgrim origin more decidedly than in their devotedness
to the public worship of the sanctuary. Here the
young and the old, the great and small, the rich and poor,
are all as steadily church-goers as were ever the pious
husbandmen of Connecticut&mdash;men of the broad breast
and giant stride&mdash;in the most "high and palmy day" of
blue-laws and tything men. You smile, reader, yet</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Noble deeds those iron men have done!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">It was these same church-going, psalm-singing husbandmen
who planted Liberty's fair tree within our borders,
the leaves of which are now for the "healing of the nations,"
and whose broad branches are overshadowing the earth;
and they watered it&mdash;ay, watered it with their blood!
The Pilgrim Fathers!&mdash;[58] the elder yeomanry of New-England!&mdash;the
Patriots of the American Revolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>!&mdash;great names!
they shall live enshrined in the heart of
Liberty long after those of many a railer are as if they
had never been. And happy, happy would it be for the
fair heritage bequeathed by them, were not the present
generation degenerate sons of noble sires.</p>

<p>At Jacksonville I tarried only a few days; but during
that short period I met with a few things of tramontane
origin, strange enough to my Yankee notions. It was the
season approaching the annual election of representatives
for the state and national councils, and on one of the days
to which I have alluded the political candidates of various
creeds <i>addressed the people</i>; that is&mdash;for the benefit of the
uninitiated be it stated&mdash;each one made manifest what
great things he had done for the people in times past, and
promised to do greater things, should the dear people, in the
overflowing of their kindness, be pleased to let their choice
fall upon him. This is a custom of universal prevalence
in the Southern and Western states, and much is urged
in its support; yet, sure it is, in no way could a Northern
candidate more utterly defeat his election than by attempting
to pursue the same. The charge of <i>self-electioneering</i>
is, indeed, a powerful engine often employed by political
partisans.</p>

<p>The candidates, upon the occasion of which I am speaking,
were six or seven in number: and though I was not
permitted to listen to the <i>eloquence</i> of all, some of these
harangues are said to have been powerful productions,
especially that of Mr. S. The day [59] was exceedingly
sultry, and Mr. W., candidate for the state Senate, was
on the <i>stump</i>, in shape of a huge meat-block at one corner
of the market-house, when I entered.<a name="FNanchor_193_196" id="FNanchor_193_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_196" class="fnanchor">193</a> He was a broadfaced,
farmer-like personage, with features imbrowned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
by exposure, and hands hardened by honourable toil; with
a huge rent, moreover, athwart his left shoulder-blade&mdash;a
badge of democracy, I presume, and either neglected
or produced there for the occasion; much upon the same
principle, doubtless, that Quintilian counselled his disciples
to disorder the hair and tumble the toga before they began
to speak. Now mind ye, reader, I do not accuse the worthy
man of having followed the Roman's instructions, or even
of acquaintance therewith, or any such thing; but, verily,
he did, in all charity, seem to have hung on his worst rigging,
and that, too, for no other reason than to demonstrate
the democracy aforesaid, and his affection for the <i>sans-culottes</i>.
His speech, though garnished with some little
rhodomontade, was, upon the whole, a sensible production.
I could hardly restrain a smile, however, at one of the
worthy man's figures, in which he likened himself to "the
<i>morning sun</i>, mounting a stump to scatter the mists which
had been gathering around his fair fame." Close upon
the heels of this <i>ruse</i> followed a beautiful simile&mdash;"a
people free as the wild breezes of their own broad prairies!"
The candidates alternated according to their political creeds,
and denounced each other in no very measured terms.
The approaching election was found, indeed, to be the
prevailing topic of thought and conversation all over the
land; insomuch [60] that the writer, himself an unassuming
wayfarer, was more than once, strangely enough, mistaken
for a <i>candidate</i> as he rode through the country, and
was everywhere <i>catechumened</i> as to the articles of his
political faith. It would be an amusing thing to a solitary
traveller in a country like this, could he always detect the
curious surmisings to which his presence gives rise in the
minds of those among whom he chances to be thrown;
especially so when, from any circumstance, his appearance
does not betray his definite rank or calling in life, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
anything of mystery hangs around his movements. Internal
Improvement seems now to be the order of the day in
Northern Illinois. This was the hobby of most of the
stump-speakers; and the projected railway from Jacksonville
to the river was under sober consideration. I became
acquainted, while here, with Mr. C., a young gentleman
engaged in laying off the route.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when I at length broke away
from the hustings, and mounted my horse to pursue my
journey to Springfield. The road strikes off from the
public square, in a direct line through the prairie, at right
angles with that by which I entered, and, <i>like</i> that, ornamented
by fine farms. I had rode but a few miles from
the village, and was leisurely pursuing my way across the
dusty plain, when a quick tramping behind attracted my
attention, and in a few moments a little, portly, red-faced
man at my side, in linsey-woolsey and a broad-brimmed
hat, saluted me frankly with the title of "friend," and
forthwith announced himself a "Baptist [61] circuit-rider!"
I became much interested in the worthy man before his path
diverged from my own; and I flatter myself he reciprocated
my regard, for he asked all manner of questions, and related
all manner of anecdotes, questioned or not. Among other
edifying matter, he gave a full-length biography of a "<i>billards
fever</i>" from which he was just recovering; even from
the premonitory symptoms thereof to the relapse and final
convalescence.</p>

<p>At nightfall I found myself alone in the heart of an extensive
prairie; but the beautiful crescent had now begun to
beam forth from the blue heavens; and the wild, fresh
breeze of evening, playing among the silvered grass-tops,
rendered the hour a delightful one to the traveller. "Spring
Island Grove," a thick wood upon an eminence to the
right, looked like a region of fairy-land as its dark foliage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
trembled in the moonlight. The silence and solitude of
the prairie was almost startling; and a Herculean figure
upon a white horse, as it drew nigh, passed me "on the
other side" with a glance of suspicion at my closely-buttoned
surtout and muffled mouth, as if to say, "this
is too lone a spot to form acquaintance." A few hours&mdash;I
had crossed the prairie, and was snugly deposited in
a pretty little farmhouse in the edge of the grove, with a
crusty, surly fellow enough for its master.</p>

</div>


<p>It is a trite remark, that few studies are more pleasing
to the inquisitive mind than that of the <i>nature of man</i>.
But, however this may be, sure it is, few situations in life
present greater facilities for watching its developments
than that of the ordinary <i>wayfaring</i> traveller. Though I
fully agree with Edmund Burke, that "the age of chivalry
has passed away," with all its rough virtues and its follies,
yet am I convinced that, even in this degenerate era of
sophisters, economists, and speculators, when a solitary
individual, unconnected with any great movements of the
day, throws himself upon his horse, and sallies fearlessly
forth upon the arena of the world, whether in <i>quest</i> of adventure
or not, he will be quite sure to meet, at least, with
some slight "inklings" thereof. A thousand exhibitions
of human character will fling themselves athwart his pathway,
inconsiderable indeed in themselves, yet which, as
days of the year and seconds of the day, go to make up
the lineaments of man; and which, from the observation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the pride, and pomp, and circumstance of wealth and
equipage, would of necessity be veiled. Under the eye of
the solitary [63] wanderer, going forth upon a pilgrimage
of observation among the ranks of men&mdash;who is met but
for once, and whose opinion, favourable or otherwise, can
be supposed to exert but trifling influence&mdash;there is not
that necessity for enveloping those petty weaknesses of
our nature in the mantle of selfishness which would,
under more imposing circumstances, exist. To the mind of
delicate sensibility, unschooled in the ways of man, such
exhibitions of human heartlessness might, perchance, be
anything but <i>interesting</i>; but to one who, elevated by
independence of character above the ordinary contingencies
of situation and circumstance, can smile at the frailties
of his race, even when exhibited at his own expense,
they can but afford a fund of interest and instruction.
The youthful student, when with fresh, unblunted feeling
he for the first time enters the dissecting-room of medical
science, turns with sickened, revolting sensibilities from
the mutilated form stretched out upon the board before
him, while the learned professor, with untrembling nerve,
lays bare its secrecies with the crimsoned knife of science.
Just so is it with the exhibitions of human nature; yet who
will say that dissection of the moral character of man is
not as indispensable to an intimate acquaintance with its
phenomena, as that of his physical organization for a similar
purpose.</p>

<p>But, then, there are the brighter features of humanity,
which sometimes hang across the wanderer's pathway like
the beautiful tints of a summer evening bow; and which, as
they are oftenest met reposing beneath the cool, sequestered
shades of [64] retirement, where the roar and tumult of
a busy world are as the heavy swing of the distant wave,
so there, oftener than elsewhere, they serve to cheer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
pilgrim traveller's heart. Ah! it is very sweet, from the
dull Rembrandt shades of which human character presents
but too much, to turn away and dwell upon these green,
beautiful spots in the wastes of humanity; these <i>oases</i> in
a desert of barrenness; to hope that man, though indeed
a depraved, unholy being, is not that <i>thing</i> of utter detestation
which a troubled bosom had sometimes forced us
to believe. At such moments, worth years of coldness
and distrust, how inexpressibly grateful is it to feel the
young tendrils of the heart springing forth to meet the
proffered affection; curling around our race, and binding
it closer and closer to ourselves. But your pardon, reader:
my wayward pen has betrayed me into an episode upon
poor human nature most unwittingly, I do assure thee.
I was only endeavouring to present a few ideas circumstances
had casually suggested, which I was sure would
commend themselves to every thinking mind, and which
some incidents of my wayfaring may serve to illustrate,
when lo! forth comes an essay on human nature. It reminds
one of Sir Hudibras, who <i>told the clock by algebra</i>,
or of Dr. Young's satirised gentlewoman, who <i>drank tea
by stratagem</i>.</p>

<p>"How little do men realize the loveliness of this visible
world!" is an exclamation which has oftentimes involuntarily
left my lips while gazing upon the surpassing splendour
of a prairie-sunrise. This is at all times a glorious
hour, but to a lonely traveller [65] on these beautiful plains
of the departed Illini, it comes on with a charm which words
are powerless to express. We call our world a <span class="smcap">Ruin</span>. Ah!
it <i>is</i> one in all its moral and physical relations; but, like
the elder cities of the Nile, how vast, how magnificent
in its desolation! The astronomer, as he wanders with
scientific eye along the sparkling galaxy of a summer's
night, tells us that among those clustering orbs, far, far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
away in the clear realms of upper sky, he catches at times
a glimpse of <i>another</i> world! a region of untold, unutterable
brightness! the high empyrean, veiled in mystery! And
so is it with our own humbler sphere; the glittering fragment
of a world <i>we</i> have never known ofttimes glances
before us, and then is gone for ever.</p>

<p>Before the dawn I had left the farmhouse where I had
passed the night, and was thridding the dark old forest
on my route to Springfield. The dusky twilight of morning
had been slowly stealing over the landscape; and, just
as I emerged once more upon my winding prairie-path,
the flaming sunlight was streaming wide and far over the
opposite heavens. Along the whole line of eastern horizon
reposed the purple dies of morning, shooting rapidly upward
into broad pyramidal shafts to the zenith, till at last
the dazzling orb came rushing above the plain, bathing
the scene in an effulgence of light. The day which succeeded
was a fine one, and I journeyed leisurely onward,
admiring the mellow glories of woodland and prairie, until
near noon, when a flashing cupola above the trees reminded
me I was approaching [66] Springfield.<a name="FNanchor_194_197" id="FNanchor_194_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_197" class="fnanchor">194</a> Owing to its
unfavourable situation and the fewness of its public structures,
this town, though one of the most important in the
state, presents not that imposing aspect to the stranger's
eye which some more inconsiderable villages can boast.
Its location is the border of an extensive prairie, adorned
with excellent farms, and stretching away on every side
to the blue line of distant forest. This town, like Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>sonville,
was laid out ten or twelve years since, but for a
long while contained only a few scattered log cabins: all
its present wealth or importance dates from the last six
years. Though inferior in many respects to its neighbour
and rival, yet such is its location by nature that it can hardly
fail of becoming a place of extensive business and crowded
population; while its geographically central situation seems
to designate it as the capital of the state. An elegant state-house
is now erecting, and the seat of government is to
be located here in 1840. The public square, a green,
pleasant lawn, enclosed by a railing, contains the courthouse
and a market, both fine structures of brick: the
sides are lined with handsome edifices. Most of the buildings
are small, however, and the humble log cabin not
unfrequently meets the eye. Among the public structures
are a jail, and several houses of worship. Society is said
to be excellent, and the place can boast much literary
taste. The plan of Internal Improvement projected for
the state, when carried out, cannot fail to render Springfield
an important place.</p>

<p>It was a cool, beautiful evening when I left Springfield
and held my way over the prairie, rolling its [67] waving
verdure on either side of my path. Long after the village
had sunk in the horizon, the bright cupola continued to
flame in the oblique rays of the setting sun. I passed
many extensive farms on my route, and in a few hours
had entered the forest and forded Sangamon <i>River</i>&mdash;so
styled out of pure courtesy, I presume, for at the spot I
crossed it seemed little more than a respectable creek,
with waters clear as crystal, flowing over clean white sand.<a name="FNanchor_195_198" id="FNanchor_195_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_198" class="fnanchor">195</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
At periods of higher stages, however, this stream has been
navigated nearly to the confluence of its forks, a distance
of some hundred miles; and in the spring of 1832 a boat
of some size arrived within five miles of Springfield. An
inconsiderable expense in removing logs and overhanging
trees, it is said, would render this river navigable for keelboats
half the year. The advantages of such a communication,
through one of the richest agricultural regions on
the globe, can hardly be estimated. The Sangamon bottom
has a soil of amazing fertility, and rears from its deep,
black mould a forest of enormous sycamores; huge, overgrown,
unshapely masses, their venerable limbs streaming
with moss. When the traveller enters the depths of these
dark old woods, a cold chill runs over his frame, and he
feels as if he were entering the sepulchre. A cheerless
twilight reigns for ever through them: the atmosphere he
inhales has an earthly smell, and is filled with floating
greenish exhalations; the moist, black mould beneath his
horse's hoofs, piled with vegetable decay for many feet,
and upon whose festering bosom the cheering light of day
has not smiled for [68] centuries, is rank and yielding:
the enormous shafts leaning in all attitudes, their naked
old roots enveloped in a green moss of velvet luxuriance,
tower a hundred feet above his head, and shut out the
heavens from his view: the huge wild-vine leaps forth at
their foot and clasps them in its deadly embrace; or the
tender ivy and pensile woodbine cluster around the aged
giants, and strive to veil with their mantling tapestry the
ravages of time. There is much cathedral pomp, much
of Gothic magnificence about all this; and one can hardly
fling off from his mind the awe and solemnity which gathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
over it amid the chill, silent, and mysterious solitude of
the scene.</p>

<p>Emerging from the river-bottom, my pathway lay along
a tract of elevated land, among beautiful forest-glades of
stately oaks, through whose long dim aisles the yellow
beams of summer sunset were now richly streaming.
Once more upon the broad prairie, and the fragment of
an iris was glittering in the eastern heavens: turning back,
my eye caught a view of that singular but splendid phenomenon,
seldom witnessed&mdash;a heavy, distant rain-shower
between the spectator and the departing sun.</p>

<p>Nightfall found me at the residence of Mr. D., an
intelligent, gentlemanly farmer, with whom I passed an
agreeable evening. I was not long in discovering that my
host was a candidate for civic honours; and that he, with
his friend Mr. L., whose speech I had subsequently the
pleasure of perusing, had just returned from Mechanicsburg,<a name="FNanchor_196_199" id="FNanchor_196_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_199" class="fnanchor">196</a>
a small village in the vicinity, where they had
been exerting themselves upon the stump to win the <i>aura
popularis</i> for the coming election. "<i>Sic itur ad astra!</i>"</p>

<p>[69] Before sunrise I had crossed the threshold of my
hospitable entertainer; and having wound my solitary way,
partially by twilight, over a prairie fifteen miles in extent,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Began to feel, as well I might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The keen demands of appetite."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Reining up my tired steed at the door of a log cabin in
the middle of the plain, the nature and extent of my necessities
were soon made known to an aged matron, who had
come forth on my approach.</p>

<p>"Some victuals you shall get, <i>stran-ger</i>; but you'll just
take your <i>creetur</i> to the crib and <i>gin</i> him his feed; <i>bekase</i>,
d'ye see, the old man is kind o' <i>drinkin</i> to-day; yester'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
was 'lection, ye know." From the depths of my sympathetic
emotions was I moved for the poor old body, who
with most dolorous aspect had delivered herself of this
message; and I had proceeded forthwith, agreeable to
instructions, to satisfy the cravings of my patient animal,
when who should appear but my tipsified host, <i>in propria
persona</i>, at the door. The little old gentleman came tottering
towards the spot where I stood, and, warmly squeezing
my hand, whispered to me, with a most irresistible
serio-comic air, "<i>that he was drunk</i>;" and "that he was
four hours last night getting home from <i>'lection</i>," as he
called it. "Now, stran-ger, you won't think hard on me,"
he continued, in his maudlin manner: "I'm a poor, drunken
old fellow! but old Jim wan't al'ays so; old Jim wan't
al'ays so!" he exclaimed, with bitterness, burying his
face in his toilworn hands, as, having now regained
the house, he seated himself with difficulty upon the [70]
doorstep. "Once, my son, old Jim could knock down,
drag out, whip, lift, or throw any man in all Sangamon,
if he <i>was</i> a <i>leetle</i> fellow: but <i>now</i>&mdash;there's the receipt
of his disgrace&mdash;there," he exclaimed, with vehemence,
thrusting forth before my eyes two brawny, gladiator arms,
in which the volumed muscles were heaving and contracting
with excitement; ironed by labour, but shockingly
mutilated. Expressing astonishment at the spectacle, he
assured me that these wounds had been torn in the flesh
by the teeth of infuriated antagonists in drunken quarrels,
though the relation seemed almost too horrible to be
true. Endeavouring to divert his mind from this disgusting
topic, on which it seemed disposed to linger with ferocious
delight, I made some inquiries relative to his farm&mdash;which
was, indeed, a beautiful one, under high culture&mdash;and
respecting the habits of the prairie-wolf, a
large animal of the species having crossed my path in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
prairie in the gray light of dawn. Upon the latter inquiry
the old man sat silent a moment with his chin leaning
on his hands. Looking up at length with an arch
expression, he said, "Stran-ger, I <i>haint</i> no <i>larnin</i>; I <i>can't</i>
read; but don't the Book say somewhere about old Jacob
and the ring-streaked cattle?" "Yes." "Well, and how
old Jake's ring-streaked and round-spotted <i>creeturs</i>, after a
<i>leetle</i>, got the better of all the stock, and overrun the
<i>univarsal</i> herd; don't the Book say so?" "Something
so." "Well, now for the wolves: they're all colours but
ring-streaked and round-spotted; and if the sucker-farmers
don't look to it, the prairie-wolves will get [71] the better
of all the geese, turkeys, and <i>hins</i> in the barnyard, speckled
or no!"</p>

<p>My breakfast was now on the table; a substantial fare
of corn-bread, butter, honey, fresh eggs, <i>fowl</i>, and <i>coffee</i>,
which latter are as invariably visitants at an Illinois table
as is bacon at a Kentucky one, and that is saying no little.
The exhilarating herb tea is rarely seen. An anecdote will
illustrate this matter. A young man, journeying in Illinois,
stopped one evening at a log cabin with a violent headache,
and requested that never-failing antidote, <i>a cup of tea</i>.
There was none in the house; and, having despatched a
boy to a distant grocery to procure a pound, he threw himself
upon the bed. In a few hours a beverage was handed
him, the first swallow of which nearly excoriated his mouth
and throat. In the agony of the moment he dashed down
the bowl, and rushed half blinded to the fireplace. Over
the blaze was suspended a huge iron kettle, half filled with
an inky fluid, seething, and boiling, and bubbling, like the
witches' caldron of unutterable things in Macbeth. The
good old lady, in her anxiety to give her sick guest a <i>strong</i>
dish of tea, having never seen the like herself or drank
thereof, and supposing it something of the nature of soup,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
very innocently and ignorantly poured the whole pound
into her largest kettle, and set it a boiling. Poultry is the
other standing dish of Illinois; and the poor birds seem
to realize that their destiny is at hand whenever a traveller
draws nigh, for they invariably hide their heads
beneath the nearest covert. Indeed, so invariably are
poultry and bacon visitants at an Illinois table, that
[72] the story <i>may</i> be true, that the first inquiry made
of the guest by the village landlord is the following: "Well,
stran-ger, what'll ye take: wheat-bread and <i>chicken fixens</i>,
or corn-bread and <i>common doins</i>?" by the latter expressive
and elegant soubriquet being signified bacon.</p>

<p>Breakfast being over, my foot was once more in the
stirrup. The old man accompanied me to the gateway,
and shaking my hand in a boisterous agony of good-nature,
pressed me to visit him again when he was <i>not drunk</i>.
I had proceeded but a few steps on my way when I
heard his voice calling after me, and turned my head:
"Stran-ger! I say, stran-ger! what do you reckon of sending
this young Jack Stewart to Congress?" "Oh, he'll
answer." "Well, and that's what I'm a going to vote;
and there's a heap o' people always thinks like old Jim
does; and that's what made 'em get me groggy last night."</p>

<p>I could not but commiserate this old man as I pursued
my journey, reflecting on what had passed. He was evidently
no common toper; for some of his remarks evinced
a keenness of observation, and a depth and shrewdness of
thought, which even the withering blight of drunkenness
had not completely deadened; and which, with other habits
and other circumstances, might have placed him far above
the beck and nod of every demagogue.</p>

<p>There are few sentiments of that great man Benjamin
Franklin for which he is more to be revered than for those
respecting the burial-place of the departed.<a name="FNanchor_197_200" id="FNanchor_197_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_200" class="fnanchor">197</a> The grave-yard
is, and should ever be deemed, a <i>holy</i> spot; consecrated,
not by the cold formalities of unmeaning ceremony,
but by the solemn sacredness of the heart. Who that has
committed to earth's cold bosom the relics of one dearer,
perchance, than existence, can ever after pass the burial-ground
with a careless heart. There is nothing which
more painfully jars upon my own feelings&mdash;if I may
except that wanton desecration of God's sanctuary in some
sections of our land [74] for a public commitia&mdash;than
to see the grave-yard slighted and abused. It is like
wounding the memory of a buried friend. And yet it is an
assertion which cannot be refuted, that, notwithstanding
the reverence which, as a people, we have failed not to
manifest for the memory of our dead, the same delicate
regard and obsequy is not with us observed in the sacred
rites as among the inhabitants of the Eastern hemisphere.
If, indeed, we may be permitted to gather up an opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
from circumstances of daily notoriety, it would seem
that the plat of ground appropriated as a cemetery in
many of the villages of our land was devoted to this most
holy of purposes solely because useless for every other;
as if, after seizing upon every spot for the benefit of the
living, this last poor <i>remnant</i> was reluctantly yielded as a
resting-place for the departed. And thus has it happened
that most of the burial-grounds of our land have either
been located in a region so lone and solitary,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You scarce would start to meet a spirit there,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">or they have been thrust out into the very midst of business,
strife, and contention; amid the glare of sunshine,
noise, and dust; "the gaudy, babbling, and remorseless
day," with hardly a wall of stones to protect them from
the inroads of unruly brutes or brutish men. It is as if
the rites of sepulture were refused, and the poor boon of
a resting-place in the bosom of our common mother denied
to her offspring; as if, in our avarice of soul, we grudged
even the last narrow house destined for all; and [75] fain
would resume the last, the only gift our departed ones may
retain. Who would not dread "<i>to die</i>" and have his lifeless
clay deposited thus! Who would not, ere the last
fleeting particle of existence had "ebbed to its finish,"
and the feeble breathing had forsaken its tenement for
ever, pour forth the anguish of his spirit in the melancholy
prayer,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When breath and sense have left this clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In yon damp vault, oh lay me not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But kindly bear my bones away<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To some lone, green, and sunny spot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Reverence for the departed is ever a beautiful feature
of humanity, and has struck us with admiration for nations
of our race who could boast but few redeeming traits beside.
It is, moreover, a circumstance not a little remarkable in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the history of funeral obsequy, that veneration for the
departed has prevailed in a ratio almost inverse to the
degree of civilization. Without attempting to account for
this circumstance, or to instance the multitude of examples
which recur to every mind in its illustration, I would only
refer to that deep religion of the soul which Nature has
implanted in the heart of her simple child of the Western
forests, teaching him to preserve and to honour the bones
of his fathers! And those mysterious mausoleums of a
former race! do they convey no meaning as they rise in
lonely grandeur from our beautiful prairies, and look
down upon the noble streams which for ages have dashed
their dark floods along their base!</p>

<p>[76] But a few years have passed away since this empire
valley of the West was first pressed by the footstep of civilized
man; and, if we except those aged sepulchres of the
past, the cities of the dead hardly yet range side by side
with the cities of the living. But this cannot <i>always</i> be;
even in this distant, beautiful land, death <i>must</i> come; and
here it doubtless has come, as many an anguished bosom
can witness. Is it not, then, meet, while the busy tide of
worldly enterprise is rolling heavily forth over this fair land,
and the costly structures of art and opulence are rising on
every side, as by the enchantment of Arabian fiction&mdash;is
it <i>not</i> meet that, amid the pauses of excitement, a solitary
thought would linger around that spot, which must surely,
reader, become the last resting-place of us all!</p>

<p>I have often, in my wanderings through this pleasant
land, experienced a thrill of delight which I can hardly
describe, to behold, on entering a little Western hamlet,
a neat white paling rising up beneath the groves in some
green, sequestered spot, whose object none could mistake.
Upon some of these, simple as they were, seemed to have
been bestowed more than ordinary care; for they betrayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
an elaborateness of workmanship and a delicacy of design
sought for in vain among the ruder habitations of the living.
This is, <i>surely</i>, as it should be; and I pity the man whose
feelings cannot appreciate such a touching, beautiful expression
of the heart. I have alluded to Franklin, and how
pleasant it is to detect the kindly, household emotions
of our nature throbbing beneath the [77] starred, dignified
breast of philosophy and science. <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>, the statesman,
the sage; he who turned the red lightnings from
their wild pathway through the skies, and rocked the iron
cradle of the mightiest democracy on the globe! we gaze
upon him with awe and astonishment; involuntarily we
yield the lofty motto presented by the illustrious Frenchman,<a name="FNanchor_198_201" id="FNanchor_198_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_201" class="fnanchor">198</a>
"<i>Eripuit fulmen c&#339;lo, mox sceptra tyrannis</i>." But
when we behold that towering intellect descending from
its throne, and intermingling its emotions even with those
of the lowliest mind, admiration and reverence are lost in
<i>love</i>.</p>

<p>The preceding remarks, which have lengthened out
themselves far beyond my design, were suggested by the
loveliness of the site of the graveyard of the little village of
Decatur. I was struck with its beauty on entering the
place. It was near sunset; in the distance slept the quiet
hamlet; upon my right, beneath the grove, peeped out the
white paling through the glossy foliage; and as the broad,
deep shadows of summer evening streamed lengthening
through the trees wide over the landscape, that little spot
seemed to my mind the sweetest one in the scene. And
should not the burial-ground be ever thus! for who shall
tell the emotions which may swell the bosom of many a
dying emigrant who here shall find his long, last rest?
In that chill hour, how will the thought of home, kindred,
friendships, childhood-scenes, come rushing over the mem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>ory!
and to lay his bones in the [78] quiet graveyard of
his own native village, perchance may draw forth many a
sorrowing sigh. But this now may never be; yet it will be
consoling to the pilgrim-heart to realize that, though the
resurrection morn shall find his relics far from the graves
of his fathers, he shall yet sleep the long slumber, and
at last come forth with those who were kind and near to
him in a stranger-land; who laid away his cold clay in no
"Potter's Field," but gathered it to their own household
sepulchre. The human mind, whatever its philosophy, can
never utterly divest itself of the idea that the spirit retains a
consciousness of the lifeless body, sympathizing with its
honour or neglect, and affected by all that variety of circumstance
which may attend its existence: and who shall say
how far this belief&mdash;superstition though it be&mdash;may
smooth or trouble the dying pillow! How soothing, too,
the reflection to the sorrow of distant friends, that their
departed one peacefully and decently was gathered to his
rest; that his dust is sleeping quietly in some sweet, lonely
spot beneath the dark groves of the far-land; that his turf
is often dewed by the teardrop of sympathy, and around
his lowly headstone waves the wild-grass ever green and
free! The son, the brother, the loved wanderer from
his father's home,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6"> &nbsp; "Is in his grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The route leading to Decatur from the west lies chiefly
through a broad branch of the "Grand Prairie," an
immense plain, sweeping diagonally, with [79] little
interruption, through the whole State of Illinois, from the
Mississippi to the Wabash. For the first time, in any considerable
number, I here met with those singular granite
masses, termed familiarly by the settlers "<i>lost rocks</i>"; in
geology, <i>boulders</i>. They are usually of a mammillated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
globular figure, the surface perfectly smooth, sometimes
six hundred tons in weight, and always lying completely
isolated, frequently some hundred miles from a quarry.
They rest upon the surface or are slightly imbedded in
the soil; and, so far as my own observation extends, are of
distinct granitic formation, of various density and composition.
Several specimens I obtained are as heavy as
metal, and doubtless contain iron. Many of them, however,
like those round masses dug from the ancient works in
Ohio, are pyritous in character. There is a mystery about
these "lost rocks" not easily solved, for no granite quarry
has ever yet been discovered in Illinois. Their appearance,
in the midst of a vast prairie, is dreary and lonely
enough.</p>

<p>The site of the town of Decatur is somewhat depressed,
and in the heart of a grove of noble oaks.<a name="FNanchor_199_202" id="FNanchor_199_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_202" class="fnanchor">199</a> Long before
the traveller reaches it, the whole village is placed before
his eye from the rounded summit of the hill, over which
winds the road. The neighbouring region is well settled;
the prairie high and rolling, and timber abundant. It is
not a large place, however; and perhaps there are few
circumstances which will render it otherwise for some
years. It contains, nevertheless, a few handsome buildings;
several trading establishments; a good tavern; is said
to be healthy; and, upon the whole, is a far [80] prettier,
neater little village than many others of loftier pretensions
through which I have passed in Illinois. The village will
be intersected by two of the principal railroads of the state,
now projected, which circumstance cannot fail to place
it in the first rank as an inland trading town.</p>

<p>My visit at Decatur was a short one; and, after tea,
just as the moon was beginning to silver the tops of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
eastern oaks, I left the village and rode leisurely through
the forest, in order to enter upon the prairie at dawn the
following day. A short distance from Decatur I again
forded the Sangamon; the same insignificant stream as
ever; and, by dint of scrambling, succeeded in attaining
the lofty summit of its opposite bank, from which the
surrounding scenery of rolling forest-tops was magnificent
and sublime. From this elevation the pathway plunged
into a thick grove, dark as Erebus, save where lighted
up by a few pale moonbeams struggling through a break
in the tree-tops, or the deep-red gleamings of the evening
sky streaming at intervals along the undergrowth. The
hour was a calm and impressive one: its very loneliness
made it sweeter; and that beautiful hymn of the Tyrolean
peasantry at sunset, as versified by Mrs. Hemans, was
forcibly recalled by the scene:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come to the sunset tree!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The day is past and gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodman's axe lies free,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the reaper's work is done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet is the hour of rest!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pleasant the wood's low sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gleaming of the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the turf whereon we lie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[81] After a ride of a few miles my path suddenly emerged
from the forest upon the edge of a boundless prairie, from
whose dark-rolling herbage, here and there along the distant
swells, was thrown back the glorious moonlight, as
if from the restless, heaving bosom of the deep. An extensive
prairie, beneath a full burst of summer moonlight,
is, indeed, a magnificent spectacle. One can hardly persuade
himself that he is not upon the ocean-shore. And
now a wild, fresh breeze, which all the day had been out
playing among the perfumed flowers and riding the green-crested
waves, came rolling in from the prairie, producing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
an undulation of its surface and a murmuring in the heavy
forest-boughs perfect in the illusion. All along the low,
distant horizon hung a thin mist of silvery gauze, which,
as it rose and fell upon the dark herbage, gave an idea of
mysterious boundlessness to the scene. Here and there
stood out a lonely, weather-beaten tree upon the plain, its
trunk shrouded in obscurity, but its leafy top sighing in
the night-breeze, and gleaming like a beacon-light in the
beams of the cloudless moon. There was a dash of fascinating
romance about the scene, which held me involuntarily
upon the spot until reminded by the chill dews of
night that I had, as yet, no shelter. On casting around
my eye, I perceived a low log cabin, half buried in vegetation,
standing alone in the skirt of the wood. Although
a miserable tenement, necessity compelled me to accept
its hospitality, and I entered. It consisted of a single
apartment, in which two beds, two stools, a cross-legged
deal table, [82] and a rough clothes-press, were the only
household furniture. A few indispensable iron utensils
sat near the fire; the water-pail and gourd stood upon the
shelf, and a half-consumed flitch of bacon hung suspended
in the chimney; but the superlatives of andirons, shovel
and tongs, etc., etc., were all unknown in this primitive
abode. A pair of "lost rocks"&mdash;<i>lost</i>, indeed&mdash;supplied
the first, and the gnarled branch of an oak was substituted
for the latter. The huge old chimney and fireplace were,
as usual, fashioned of sticks and bedaubed with clay; yet
everything looked neat, yea, <i>comfortable</i>, in very despite of
poverty itself. A young female with her child, an infant
boy, in her arms, was superintending the preparation of
the evening meal. Her language and demeanour were
superior to the miserable circumstances by which she was
surrounded; and though she moved about her narrow
demesne with a quiet, satisfied air, I was not long in learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>ing
that <i>affection</i> alone had transplanted this exotic of the
prairie from a more congenial soil. What woman does
not love to tell over those passages of her history in which
the <i>heart</i> has ruled lord of the ascendant? and how very
different in this respect is our sex from hers! Man, proud
man, "the creature of interest and ambition," often blushes
to be reminded that he has a heart, while woman's cheek
mantles with the very intensity of its pulsation! The
husband in a few minutes came in from attending to my
horse; the rough table was spread; a humble fare was
produced; all were seated; and then, beneath that miserable
roof, [83] around that meager board, before a morsel
of the food, poor as it was, passed the lip of an individual,
the iron hand of toil was reverently raised, and a grateful
heart called down a blessing from the Mightiest! Ah!
thought I, as I beheld the peaceful, satisfied air of that
poor man, as he partook of his humble evening meal with
gratefulness, little does the son of luxury know the calm
contentment which fills his breast! And the great God,
as he looks down upon his children and reads their hearts,
does he not listen to many a warmer, purer thank-offering
from beneath the lowly roof-tree of the wilderness, than
from all the palaces of opulence and pride? So it has

<p>The humble repast was soon over; and, without difficulty,
I entered into conversation with the father of the
family. He informed me that he had been but a few years
a resident of Illinois; that he had been unfortunate; and
that, recently, his circumstances had become more than
usually circumscribed, from his endeavours to save from
speculators a pre-emption right of the small farm he was
cultivating. This farm was his <i>all</i>; and, in his solicitude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
to retain its possession, he had disposed of every article of
the household which would in any way produce money,
even of a part of his own and his wife's wardrobe. I found
him a man of considerable intelligence, and he imparted
to me some facts respecting that singular sect styling themselves
Mormonites of which I was previously hardly aware.
Immense [84] crowds of these people had passed his door
on the great road from Terre Haute, all with families and
household effects stowed away in little one-horse wagons
of peculiar construction, and on their journey to Mount
Zion, the New Jerusalem, situated near Independence,
Jackson county, Missouri! Their observance of the Sabbath
was almost pharisaically severe, never permitting
themselves to travel upon that day; the men devoting it
to hunting, and the females to washing clothes, and other
operations of the camp! It was their custom, likewise,
to hold a preachment in every village or settlement, whether
men would hear or forbear: the latter must have been the
case with something of a majority, I think, since no one
with whom I have ever met could, for the life of him,
give a subsequent expose of <i>Mormonism</i>, "though often
requested."</p>

</div></div>

<p>They assert that an angelic messenger has appeared to
Joe Smith, announcing the millennial dawn at hand; that
a glorious city of the faithful&mdash;the New Jerusalem, with
streets of gold and gates of pearl&mdash;is about to be reared
upon Mount Zion, Mo., where the Saviour will descend
and establish a kingdom to which there shall be no end;
ergo, argue these everlasting livers, it befits all good citizens
to get to Independence, Jackson county, aforesaid, as fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
as one-horse wagons will convey them!<a name="FNanchor_200_203" id="FNanchor_200_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_203" class="fnanchor">200</a> Large quantities
of arms and ammunition have, moreover, been [85]
forwarded, so that the item of "the sword being beaten
into a ploughshare, and spear into pruning-hook," seems
not of probable fulfilment according to these worthies.
The truth of the case is, they anticipated a brush with the
long-haired "pukes"<a name="FNanchor_201_204" id="FNanchor_201_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_204" class="fnanchor">201</a> before securing a "demise, release,
and for ever quitclaim" to Zion Hill, said <i>pukes</i> having
already at sundry times manifested a refractory spirit,
and, from the following anecdote of my good man of the
hut, in "rather a ridic'lous manner." I am no voucher
for the story: I give it as related; "and," as Ben Jonson
says, "what he has possessed me withal, I'll discharge
it amply."</p>

<p>"One Sabbath evening, when the services of the congregation
of the Mormonites were over, the Rev. Joe Smith,
priest and prophet, announced to his expectant tribe that,
on the succeeding Sabbath, the baptismal sacrament would
take place, when an angel would appear on the opposite
bank of the stream. Next Sabbath came, and 'great was
the company of the people' to witness the miraculous visitation.
The baptism commenced, and was now wellnigh
concluded: 'Do our eyes deceive us! can such things
<i>be</i>! The prophecy! the angel!' were exclamations which
ran through the multitude, as a fair form, veiled in a loose
white garment, with flowing locks and long bright pinions,
stood suddenly before the assembled multitude upon the
opposite shore, and then disappeared! All was amazement,
consternation, awe! But where is Joe Smith? In a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
moments Joe Smith was with them, and their faith was
confirmed.</p>

<p>[86] "Again was a baptism appointed&mdash;again was the
angel announced&mdash;a larger congregation assembled&mdash;and
yet again did the angel appear. At that moment
two powerful men sprang from a thicket, rushed upon the
angelic visitant, and, amid mingling exclamations of horror
and <i>execrations</i> of piety from the spectators, tore away his
long white wings, his hair and robe, and plunged him into
the stream! By some unaccountable metamorphosis, the
angel emerged from the river honest Joe Smith, priest of
Mormon, finder of the golden plates, etc., etc., and the
magi of the enchantment were revealed in the persons of
two brawny <i>pukes</i>." Since then, the story concludes, not
an angel has been seen all about Mount Zion! The miracle
of walking upon water was afterward essayed, but
failed by the removal, by some impious wags, of the <i>benches</i>
prepared for the occasion. It is truly astonishing to what
lengths superstition has run in some sections of this same
Illinois. Not long since, a knowing farmer in the county
of Macon conceived himself ordained of heaven a promulgator
to the world of a system of "New Light," so styled,
upon "a plan entirely new." No sooner did the idea strike
his fancy, than, leaving the plough in the middle of the
furrow, away sallies he to the nearest village, and admonishes
every one, everywhere, forthwith to be baptized by
his heaven-appointed hands, and become a regenerate man
on the spot. Many believed&mdash;was there ever faith too
preposterous to obtain proselytes? the doctrine, in popular
phrase, "took mightily;" and, it must be confessed, the
whole world, men, women, and children, were [87] in a
fair way for regeneration. Unfortunately for that desirable
consummation, at this crisis certain simple-hearted people
thereabouts, by some freak of fancy or other, took it into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
their heads that the priest himself manifested hardly that
<i>quantum</i> of the regenerated spirit that beseemed so
considerable a functionary. Among other peccadilloes,
he had unhappily fallen into a habit every Sabbath morning,
when he rode in from his farmhouse&mdash;a neat little
edifice which the good people had erected for his benefit
in the outskirts of the village&mdash;of trotting solemnly up
before the grocery-door upon his horse, receiving a glass
of some dark-coloured liquid, character unknown, drinking
it off with considerable gusto, dropping a <i>picayune</i> into
the tumbler, then proceeding to the pulpit, and, on the
inspiration of the mysterious potation, holding vehemently
forth. Sundry other misdeeds of the reverend man near
about the same time came to light, so that at length the
old women pronounced that terrible fiat, "the preacher
was no <i>better</i> than he should be;" which means, as everybody
knows, that he was a good deal <i>worse</i>. And so the
men, old and young, chimed in, and the priest was politely
advised to decamp before the doctrine should get unsavoury.
Thus ended the glorious discovery of New-lightism!</p>

<p>It is a humiliating thing to review the aberrations of the
human mind: and, believe me, reader, my intention in
reviewing these instances of religious fanaticism has been
not to excite a smile of transient merriment, nor for a
moment to call in question the [88] reality of true devotion.
My intention has been to show to what extremes of preposterous
folly man may be hurried when he once resigns
himself to the vagaries of fancy upon a subject which
demands the severest deductions of reason. It is, indeed, a
<i>melancholy</i> consideration, that, in a country like our own,
which we fondly look upon as the hope of the world, and
amid the full-orbed effulgence of the nineteenth century,
there should exist a body of men, more than twelve thousand
in number, as is estimated, professing belief in a faith so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
unutterably absurd as that styled Mormonism; a faith which
would have disgraced the darkest hour of the darkest era
of our race.<a name="FNanchor_202_205" id="FNanchor_202_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_205" class="fnanchor">202</a> But it is not for me to read the human

<p>Merrily, merrily did the wild night-wind howl, and
whistle, and rave around the little low cabin beneath
whose humble roof-tree the traveller had lain himself to
rest. Now it would roar and rumble down the huge wooden
chimney, and anon sigh along the tall grass-tops and
through the crannies like the wail of some lost one of the
waste. The moonbeams, at intervals darkened by the
drifting clouds and again pouring gloriously forth, streamed
in long threads of silver through the shattered walls; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the shaggy forest in the back-ground, tossing its heavy
branches against the troubled sky, [90] roared forth a deep
chorus to the storm. It was a wild night, and so complete
was the illusion that, in the fitful lullings of the tempest,
one almost imagined himself on the ocean-beach, listening
to the confused weltering of the surge. There was much
of high sublimity in all this; and hours passed away
before the traveller, weary as he was, could quiet his
mind to slumber. There are seasons when every chord,
and nerve, and sinew of the system seems wound up to
its severest tension; and a morbid, unnatural excitement
broods over the mind, forbidding all approach to quietude.
Every one has <i>experienced</i> this under peculiar circumstances;
few can <i>describe</i> it.</p>

<p>The night wore tediously away, and at the dawn the
traveller was again in the saddle, pushing forth like a
"pilgrim-bark" upon the swelling ocean-waste, sweeping
even to the broad curve of undulating horizon beyond.
There is always something singularly unpleasant in the
idea of going out upon one of these vast prairies <i>alone</i>;
and such the sense of utter loneliness, that the solitary
traveller never fails to cast back a lingering gaze upon the
last low tenement he is leaving. The winds were still up,
and the rack and clouds were scudding in wild confusion
along the darkened sky;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here, flying loosely as the mane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a young war-horse in the blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, roll'd in masses dark and swelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As proud to be the thunder's dwelling!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">From time to time a heavy blast would come careering [91]
with resistless fury along the heaving plain, almost tearing
the rider from his horse. The celebrated "Grand Prairie,"
upon which I was now entering, stretched itself away to
the south thirty miles, a vast, unbroken meadow; and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
may conceive, not describe, the terrible fury of a storm-wind
sweeping over a surface like this.<a name="FNanchor_203_206" id="FNanchor_203_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_206" class="fnanchor">203</a> As the morning
advanced, the violence of the tempest lulled into fitful
gusts; and, as the centre of the vast amphitheatre was
attained, a scene of grandeur and magnificence opened to
my eye such as it never before had looked upon. Elevated
upon a full roll of the prairie, the glance ranged over
a scene of seemingly limitless extent; for upon every side,
for the first time in my ramble, the deep blue line of the
horizon and the darker hue of the waving verdure blended
into one.</p>

<p>The touching, delicate loveliness of the lesser prairies,
so resplendent in brilliancy of hue and beauty of outline,
I have often dwelt upon with delight. The graceful undulation
of slope and swell; the exquisite richness and freshness
of the verdure flashing in native magnificence; the
gorgeous dies of the matchless and many-coloured flowers
dallying with the winds; the beautiful woodland points and
promontories shooting forth into the mimic sea; the far-retreating,
shadowy <i>coves</i>, going back in long vistas into
the green wood; the curved outline of the dim, distant
horizon, caught at intervals through the openings of the
forest; and the whole gloriously lighted up by the early
radiance of morning, as with rosy footsteps she came
dancing [92] over the dew-gemmed landscape; all these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
constituted a scene in which beauty unrivalled was the
sole ingredient. And then those bright enamelled clumps
of living emerald, sleeping upon the wavy surface like the
golden Hesperides of classic fiction, or, like another cluster
of Fortunate Isles in the dark-blue waters, breathing a
fragrance as from oriental bowers; the wild-deer bounding
in startled beauty from his bed, and the merry note of the
skylark, whistling, with speckled vest and dew-wet wing,
upon the resin-weed, lent the last touchings to Nature's
<i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, beautiful, still beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though long and lone the way."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the scene amid which I was now standing could
boast an aspect little like this. Here, indeed, were the
rare and delicate flowers; and life, in all its fresh and
beautiful forms, was leaping forth in wild and sportive
luxuriance at my feet. But all was vast, measureless,
Titanic; and the loveliness of the picture was lost in its
grandeur. Here was no magnificence of <i>beauty</i>, no <i>gorgeousness</i>
of vegetation, no <i>splendour</i> of the wilderness;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Green isles and circling shores <i>ne'er</i> blended here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wild reality!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">All was bold and impressive, reposing in the stern, majestic
solitude of Nature. On every side the earth heaved and
rolled like the swell of troubled waters; now sweeping away
in the long heavy wave of ocean, and now rocking and
curling like the abrupt, broken bay-billow tumbling around
the [93] crag. Between the lengthened parallel ridges
stretch the ravines by which the prairie is drained; and,
owing to the depth and tenacity of the soil, they are sometimes
almost impassable. Ascending from these, the elevation
swells so gradually as to be almost imperceptible
to the traveller, until he finds himself upon the summit,
and the immense landscape is spread out around him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"The clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep over with their shadows, and beneath,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dark hollows seem to glide along and chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunny ridges."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">The diversity of light and shade upon the swells and depressions
at the hour of sunrise, or when at midday clouds
are drifting along the sky, is endless. A few points here
and there are thrown into prominent relief; while others,
deeply retreating, constitute an imaginary back-ground
perfect in its kind. And then the sunlight, constantly
changing its position, is received upon such a variety of
angles, and these, too, so rapidly vary as the breeze rolls
over the surface, that it gives the scene a wild and shifting
aspect to the eye at times, barely reconcilable with the
idea of reality.</p>

<p>As the sun reached the meridian the winds went down,
and then the stillness of death hung over the prairie. The
utter desolateness of such a scene is indescribable. Not
a solitary tree to intercept the vision or to break the monotony;
not a sound to cheer the ear or relieve the desolation;
not a living [94] thing in all that vast wild plain to tell the
traveller that he was not</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">Alone on a wide, wide sea!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">It is at such a season that the question presents itself with
more than ordinary vehemence to the mind, <i>To what circumstance
do these vast prairies owe their origin</i>? Amid
what terrible convulsion of the elements did these great
ocean-plains heave themselves into being? What mighty
voice has rolled this heaped-up surface into tumult, and
then, amid the storm and the tempest, bid the curling
billows stand, and fixed them there?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The hand that built the firmament hath heaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth'd these verdant swells."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The origin of the prairie has given rise to much speculation.
Some contend that we are to regard these vast
plains in the same light as mountains, valleys, forests,
and other grand features of Nature's workmanship. And,
it is very true, plains of a character not dissimilar are to be
met with all over our earth; at every degree of elevation
of every extent, and of every stage of fertility, from the
exhaustless fecundity of the delta of the Nile to the barren
sterility of the sands of the desert. Northern Asia has her
boundless <i>pastures</i> and <i>steppes</i>, where the wild Tartar feeds
his flock; Africa may boast her Bedouin <i>sands</i>, her <i>tablelands</i>,
and her <i>karroos</i>; South America her grassy <i>llanos</i>
and <i>pampas</i>; Europe her purple <i>heather</i>; India her <i>jungles</i>;
the southern sections of our own land their beautiful
<i>savannas</i>; and wherefore not the [95] vast regions of the
"Far West" their broad-rolling <i>prairies</i>? The word is
of French derivation, signifying <i>meadow</i>; and is applied
to every description of surface destitute of timber and
clothed with grass. It was, then, upon their own fair
prairies of Judea and Mesopotamia that the ancient patriarchs
pitched their tents. The tough sward of the prairie,
when firmly formed, it is well known, refuses to receive
the forest; but, once broken into by the ploughshare or
by any other cause, and protected from the autumnal
flames, and all is soon rolling with green; and the sumach,
the hazel, and the wild-cherry are succeeded by the oak.
Such is the argument for the <i>natural</i> origin of the prairie,
and its cogency none will deny. But, assuming for a
moment a <i>diluvial</i> origin to these vast plains, as a thousand
circumstances concur to indicate, and the phenomena are
far more satisfactorily and philosophically resolved. In a
soil so exhaustlessly fertile, the grasses and herbs would
first secure possession of the surface. Even now, whenever
the earth is thrown up, from whatever depth, it is imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>diately
mossed with verdure by the countless embryos buried
in its teeming bosom; a proof incontestable of secondary
origin. After the grasses succeeded flowering shrubs; then
the larger weeds; eventually, thickets were formed; the
surface was baked and hardened by the direct rays of the
sun, and the bosom of the soil, bound up as if by bands of
brass and iron, utterly refused to receive or nourish the
seeds of the forest now strewn over it. This is the unavoidable
conclusion wherever natural [96] causes have held
their sway. Upon the borders of rivers, creeks, and overflowing
streams, or wherever the soil has become broken,
this series of causes was interrupted, and the result we
see in the numerous island-groves, and in the forests which
invariably fringe the water-courses, great and small. The
autumnal fires, too, aboriginal tradition informs us, have
annually swept these vast plains from an era which the
memory of man faileth to record, scathing and consuming
every bush, shrub, or thicket which in the lapse of ages
might have aspired to the dignity of a tree; a nucleus
around which other trees might have clustered. Here and
there, indeed, amid the heaving waste, a desolate, wind-shaken,
flame-blackened oak rears its naked branches in
the distance; but it is a stricken thing, and only confirms
the position assumed. From a concurrence of fortuitous
circumstances easily conceived, the solitary seed was received
into a genial soil; the tender shrub and the sapling
were protected from destruction, and at length it had struggled
into the upper air, and defied alike the flames and
blasts of the prairie.</p>

<p>The argument of <i>analogy</i> for the <i>natural origin</i> of the
prairie may also be fairly questioned, since careful examination
of the subject must convince any unprejudiced
mind that the similarity of feature between these plains
and others with which we are acquainted is not sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
striking to warrant comparison. The <i>pampas</i>, the <i>steppes</i>,
and the <i>sand-plains</i>, though not unlike in the more prominent
characteristics, are yet widely different [97] in configuration,
extent, and soil. The prairie combines characteristics
of each, exhibiting features of all in <i>common</i>,
of no one in <i>particular</i>. Who would institute comparison
between the dark-rolling luxuriance of the North American
prairie, and the gloomy moor of Northern Europe,
with its heavy, funereal mantle of heather and <i>ling</i>. Could
the rifest fancy conjure up the <i>weird sisters</i>, all "so
withered and so wild in their attire," upon these beautiful
plains of the departed Illini! Nor do we meet in the thyme-breathing
downs of "merry England," the broad rich
levels of France, the grape-clad highlands of Spain, or in
the golden mellowness of the Italian <i>Campagna</i>, with a
similitude of feature sufficiently striking to identify our own
glorious prairies with them. Europe can boast, indeed,
no peculiarity of surface assuming like configuration or
exhibiting like phenomena.</p>

<p>When, then, we reflect, that of all those plains which
spread out themselves upon our globe, the North American
prairie possesses characteristics peculiar to itself, and to
be met with nowhere beside; when we consider the demonstrations
of a soil of origin incontestably diluvial; when
we wander over the heaving, billowy surface, and behold it
strewed with the rocky offspring of another region, and,
at intervals, encased in the saline crust of the ocean-sediment;
when we dive into its fathomless bosom, and bring
forth the crumbling relics of man and animal from sepulchres
into which, for untold cycles, they have been
entombed; and when we linger along those rolling streams
by which they [98] are intersected, and behold upon their
banks the mighty indications of whirling, subsiding floods,
and behold buried in the heart of the everlasting rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
productions only of the sea, the conviction is forced upon
us, almost resistlessly, that here the broad ocean once
heaved and roared. To what circumstance, indeed, but
a revolution of nature like this, are we to refer that uniform
deposition of earthy strata upon the alluvial bottom-land
of every stream? to what those deep-cut race-paths
which the great streams have, in the lapse of centuries,
worn for themselves through the everlasting rock, hundreds
of feet? to what those vast salt-plains of Arkansas? those
rocky heaps of the same mineral on the Missouri, or those
huge isolated masses of limestone, rearing themselves amid
the lonely grandeur, a wonder to the savage? Or to what
else shall we refer those collections of enormous seashells,
heaped upon the soil, or thrown up to its surface from a
depth of fifty feet?</p>

<p>Many phenomena in the Valley of the Mississippi concur
to confirm the idea that its vast delta-plains, when first
forsaken by the waters of the ocean, were possessed by
extensive canebrakes, covering, indeed, its entire surface.
If, then, we suppose the Indians, who passed from Asia
to America in the early centuries of the Christian era, to
have commenced the fires in autumn when the reed was
like tinder, and the conflagration would sweep over boundless
regions, we at once have an hypothesis which accounts
for the origin of the prairies. It is at least as plausible as
some others. The occasions of the autumnal fires may
have been [99] various. The cane-forests must have presented
an insurmountable obstacle in travelling, hunting,
agriculture, or even residence; while the friction caused
by the tempestuous winds of autumn may have kindled
numerous fires among the dry reeds.</p>

<p>The surface peculiar to the prairie is first perceived
in the State of Ohio. As we proceed north and west it
increases in extent, until, a few hundred miles beyond the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Mississippi, it rolls on towards the setting sun, in all the
majesty and magnificence of boundlessness, to the base
of the Rocky Mountains. Such are the beautiful prairies
of the fair Far West; and if, gentle reader, my pen, all
rapid though it be, has lingered tediously to thee along
their fairy borders, it may yet prove no small consolation
to thy weariness to reflect that its errings upon the subject
are wellnigh ended.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the day, as I have intimated, when
I reached the centre of that broad branch of the Grand
Prairie over which I was passing; and, mile after mile,
the narrow pathway, almost obliterated here and there
by the waving vegetation, continued to wind itself along.
With that unreflecting carelessness which characterizes the
inexperienced wayfarer, I had left behind me the last human
habitation I was for hours to look upon, without the slightest
refreshment; and now the demands of unappeased nature,
sharpened by exercise, by the keen atmosphere of the
prairies, and, probably, by the force of fancy, which never
fails to aggravate privations which we know to be remediless,
had become absolutely painful. The faithful animal
beneath [100] me, also, from the total absence of water
along our path, was nearly exhausted; and there, before
and around, and on every side, not an object met the
view but the broad-rolling, limitless prairie, and the
dim, misty horizon in the distance. Above, the heavens
were calm and blue, and the bright sun was careering on
in his giant course as gloriously as if the storm-cloud had
never swept his path. League after league the prairie
lay behind me, and still swell upon swell, wave after wave,
heaved up itself in endless succession before the wearied
eye. There <i>is</i> a point, reader, in physical, not less than
in moral affairs, where forbearance ceases to be a virtue;
and, veritably, suggestions bordering on the horrible were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
beginning to flit athwart the fancy, when, happily, a long,
low, wavering cloud-like line was caught stretching itself
upon the extremest verge of the misty horizon. My jaded
animal was urged onward; and slowly, <i>very</i> slowly, the
dim outline undulated upward, and the green forest rose
gradually before the gladdened vision! A few miles, the
path plunged into the green, fresh woods; crossed a deep
creek, which betrayed its meandering by the grove along
its banks, and the hungry traveller threw himself from his
horse before a log cabin imbowered in the trees. The
spot was one of those luxuriant copses in the heart of the
prairie, comprising several hundred acres, so common in
the northern sections of Illinois. "<i>Victuals and drink!</i>"
were, of course, the first demand from a female who showed
herself at the door; and, "<i>I judge</i>" was the laconic but
cheering [101] reply. She stared with uncontrolled curiosity
at her stranger-guest. At the moment he must have
looked a perfect incarnation of ferocity; a very genius of
famine and starvation; but, all in good time, he was luxuriating
over a huge fragment of swine's flesh, a bowl of
honey, and a loaf of bread; and soon were his <i>miseries</i>
over. What! honey and hog's flesh not a luxury! Say ye
so, reader! Verily, then, were ye never half starved in the
heart of a Western prairie!</p>

<p>Among that novel variety of feature which the perspicacity
of European tourists in America has enabled them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
to detect of Cis-atlantic character, two traits seem ever to
stand forth in striking relief, and are dwelt upon with
very evident satisfaction: I allude to Avarice and Curiosity.
Upon the former of these characteristics it is not my purpose
to comment; though one can hardly have been a
traveller, in any acceptation of the term, or in almost any
section of our land, without having arrived at a pretty
decided opinion upon the subject. Curiosity, [102] however,
it will not, I am persuaded, be denied, <i>does</i> constitute
a feature, and no inconsiderable one, in our national character;
nor would it, perhaps, prove a difficult task to lay
the finger upon those precise circumstances in our origin
and history as a people which have tended to superinduce
a trait of this kind&mdash;a trait so disgusting in its ultra development;
and yet, in its ultimate nature, so indispensably
the mainspring of everything efficient in mind. "<i>Low
vice</i>," as the author of Childe Harold has been pleased to
stigmatize it; yet upon this single propellant may, in retrospect,
be predicated the cause of more that contributes to
man's happiness than perhaps upon any other. <i>Frailty
of a little mind</i>, as it <i>may</i> be, and is often deemed; yet not
the less true is it that the omnipotent workings of this
passion have ever been, and must, until the nature of the
human mind is radically changed, continue to remain, at
once the necessary concomitant and the essential element
of a vigorous understanding. If it be, then, indeed true,
as writers and critics beyond the waters would fain have
us believe, that American national character is thus compounded,
so far from blushing at the discovery, we would
hail it as a leading cause of our unparalleled advancement
as a people in the time past, and as an unerring omen of
progression in future.</p>

<p>My pen has been insensibly betrayed into these remarks
in view of a series of incidents which, during my few months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
rambling, have from time to time transpired; and which,
while they illustrate forcibly to my mind the position I
have assumed, [103] have also demonstrated conclusively
the minor consideration, that the passion, in all its <i>phenomena</i>,
is by no means, as some would have us believe,
restricted to any one portion of our land; that it <i>is</i>, in
verity, a characteristic of the entire Anglo-American race!
Thus much for <i>sage forensic</i> upon "that low vice, curiosity."</p>

<p>My last number left me luxuriating, with all the gusto
of an amateur prairie-wolf fresh from his starving lair,
upon the <i>fat</i> and <i>honey</i> of Illinois. During these blessed
moments of trencher devotion, several inmates of the little
cabin whose hospitality I was enjoying, who had been
labouring in the field, successively made their appearance;
and to each individual in turn was the traveller handed
over, like a bale of suspected contraband merchandise, for
supervision. The interrogatories of each were quite the
same, embracing name and nativity, occupation, location,
and destination, administered with all the formal exactitude
of a county-court lawyer. With the inquiries of none,
however, was I more amused than with those of a little
corpulent old fellow ycleped "Uncle Bill," with a proboscis
of exceeding rubicundity, and eyes red as a weasel's, to
say nothing of a voice melodious in note as an asthmatic
clarionet. The curiosity of the Northern Yankee is, in
all conscience, unconscionable enough when aroused; but,
for the genuine quintessence of inquisitiveness, commend
your enemy, if you have one, to an army of starving gallinippers,
or to a backwoods' family of the Far West, who
see a traveller twice a year, and don't take the newspaper!
Now [104] mark me, reader! I mention this not as
a <i>fault</i> of the worthy "Suckers:"<a name="FNanchor_204_207" id="FNanchor_204_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_207" class="fnanchor">204</a> it is rather a misfor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>tune;
or, if otherwise, it surely "leans to virtue's side."
A <i>peculiarity</i>, nevertheless, it certainly is; and a striking
one to the stranger. Inquiries are constantly made with
most unblushing effrontery, which, under ordinary circumstances,
would be deemed but a single remove from insult,
but at which, under those to which I refer, a man of sense
would not for a moment take exception. It is <i>true</i>, as some
one somewhere has said, that a degree of inquisitiveness
which in the more crowded walks of life would be called
impertinent, is perfectly allowable in the wilderness; and
nothing is more conceivable than desire for its gratification.
As to the people of Illinois, gathered as they are from every
"kindred, and nation, and tribe, and language under
heaven," there are traits of character among them which
one could wish universally possessed. Kind, hospitable,
open-hearted, and confiding have I ever found them, whether
in the lonely log cabin of the prairie or in the overflowing
settlement; and some noble spirits <i>I</i> have met whose presence
would honour any community or people.</p>

<p>After my humble but delicious meal was concluded, mine
host, a tall, well-proportioned, sinewy young fellow, taking
down his rifle from the <i>beckets</i> in which it was reposing
over the rude mantel, very civilly requested me to accompany
him on a hunting ramble of a few hours in the vicinity
for deer. Having but a short evening ride before me, I
readily consented; and, leaving the cabin, we strolled [105]
leisurely through the shady woods, along the banks of the
creek I have mentioned, for several miles; but, though
indications of deer were abundant, without success. We
were again returning to the hut, which was now in sight
on the prairie's edge, when, in the middle of a remark upon
the propriety of "<i>disposing of a part of his extensive farm</i>,"
the rifle of my companion was suddenly brought to his
eye; a sharp crack, and a beautiful doe, which the moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
before was bounding over the nodding wild-weeds like the
summer wind, lay gasping at our feet.</p>

<p>So agreeable did I find my youthful hunter, that I was
wellnigh complying with his request to "tarry with him
yet a few days," and try my own hand and eye, all unskilled
though they be, in <i>gentle venerie</i>; or, at the least,
to taste a steak from the fine fat doe. <i>Sed fugit, interea
fugit, irreparabile tempus</i>; and when the shades of evening
were beginning to gather over the landscape, I had passed
over a prairie some eight miles in breadth; and, chilled
and uncomfortable from the drenching of a heavy shower,
was entering the village of Shelbyville through the trees.<a name="FNanchor_205_208" id="FNanchor_205_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_208" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>This is a pleasant little town enough, situated on the west
bank of the Kaskaskia River, in a high and heavily-timbered
tract. It is the seat of justice for the county from which
it takes its name, which circumstance is fearfully portended
by a ragged, bleak-looking structure called a courthouse.
Its shattered windows, and flapping doors, and weather-stained
bricks, when associated with the object to which
it is appropriated, perched up as it is in the [106] centre of
the village, reminds one of a cornfield scarecrow, performing
its duty by looking as hideous as possible. <i>In terrorem</i>,
in sooth. Dame Justice seems indeed to have met with
most shameful treatment all over the West, through her
legitimate representative the courthouse. The most interesting
object in the vicinity of Shelbyville is a huge sulphur-spring,
which I did not tarry long enough to visit.</p>

<p>"Will you be pleased, sir, to register your name?" was
the modest request of mine host, as, having <i>settled the bill</i>,
with foot in stirrup, I was about mounting my steed at
the door of the little hostlerie of Shelbyville the morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
after my arrival. Tortured by the pangs of a curiosity
which it was quite evident must now or never be gratified,
he had pursued his guest <i>beyond the threshold</i> with this
<i>dernier resort</i> to elicit <i>a</i> name and residence. "Register
my name, sir!" was the reply. "And pray, let me ask,
where do you intend that desirable operation to be performed?"
The discomfited publican, with an expression
of ludicrous dismay, hastily retreating to the bar-room,
soon reappeared gallanting a mysterious-looking little blue-book,
with "Register" in ominous characters portrayed
upon the back thereof. <i>A</i> name was accordingly soon
despatched with a pencil, beneath about a dozen others,
which the honest man had probably managed to <i>save</i> in
as many years; and, applying the spur, the last glance of
the traveller caught the eager features of his host poring
over this new accession to his treasure.</p>

<p>[107] The early air of morning was intensely chilling as
I left the village and pursued my solitary way through the
old woods; but, as the sun went up the heavens, and the
path emerged upon the open prairie, the transition was astonishing.
The effect of emerging from the dusky shades of a
thick wood upon a prairie on a summer day is delightful
and peculiar. I have often remarked it. It impresses one
like passing from the damp, gloomy closeness of a cavern
into the genial sunshine of a flower-garden. For the first
time during my tour in Illinois was my horse now severely
troubled by that terrible insect, so notorious all over the
West, the large green-bottle prairie-fly, called the "green-head."
My attention was first attracted to it by observing
several gouts of fresh blood upon the rein; and, glancing
at my horse's neck, my surprise was great at beholding
an orifice quite as large as that produced by the <i>fleam</i>
from which the dark fluid was freely streaming. The
instant one of these fearful insects plants itself upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
horse's body, the rider is made aware of the circumstance
by a peculiar restlessness of the animal in every limb, which
soon becomes a perfect agony, while the sweat flows forth
at every pore. The last year<a name="FNanchor_206_209" id="FNanchor_206_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_209" class="fnanchor">206</a> was a remarkable one for
countless swarms of these flies; many animals were <i>killed</i>
by them; and at one season it was even dangerous to
venture across the broader prairies except before sunrise
or after nightfall. In the early settlement of the county,
these insects were so troublesome as in [108] a great
measure to retard the cultivation of the prairies; but, within
a few years, a yellow insect larger than the "green-head"
has made its appearance wherever the latter was found,
and, from its sweeping destruction of the annoying fly,
has been called the "horse-guard." These form burrows
by penetrating the earth to some depth, and there
depositing the slaughtered "green-heads." It is stated
that animals become so well aware of the relief afforded
by these insects and of their presence, that the traveller
recognises their arrival at once by the quiet tranquillity
which succeeds the former agitation. Ploughing upon the
prairies was formerly much delayed by these insects, and
heavy netting was requisite for the protection of the oxen.</p>

<p>At an inconsiderable settlement called <i>Cold Spring</i>, after
a ride of a dozen miles, I drew up my horse for refreshment.<a name="FNanchor_207_210" id="FNanchor_207_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_210" class="fnanchor">207</a>
My host, a venerable old gentleman, with brows
silvered over by the frosts of sixty winters, from some circumstance
unaccountable, presumed his guest a political
circuit-rider, and arranged his remarks accordingly. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
old man's politics were, however, not a little musty. Henry
Clay was spoken of rather as a young aspirant for distinction,
just stepping upon the arena of public life, than as
the aged statesman about resigning "the seals of office,"
and, hoary with honour, withdrawing from the world.
Nathless, much pleased was I with my host. He was a
native of Connecticut, and twenty years had seen him a
resident in "the Valley."</p>

<p>Resuming my route, the path conducted through [109]
a high wood, and for the first time since my departure
from New-England was my ear charmed by the sweet,
melancholy note of the robin, beautiful songster of my own
native North. A wanderer can hardly describe his emotions
on an occurrence like this. The ornithology of the
West, so far as a limited acquaintance will warrant assertion,
embraces many of the most magnificent of the feathered
creation. Here is found the jay, in gold and azure, most
splendid bird of the forest; here the woodpecker, with flaming
crest and snowy capote; the redbird; the cardinal grosbeak,
with his mellow whistle, gorgeous in crimson dies;
the bluebird, delicate as an iris; the mockbird, unrivalled
chorister of our land; the thrush; the wishton-wish; the
plaintive whippoorwill; and last, yet not the least, the turtle-dove,
with her flutelike moaning. How often, on my solitary
path, when all was still through the grove, and heaven's
own breathings for a season seemed hushed, have I reined
up my horse, and, with feelings not to be described, listened
to the redundant pathos of that beautiful woodnote swelling
on the air! Paley has somewhere<a name="FNanchor_208_211" id="FNanchor_208_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_211" class="fnanchor">208</a> told us, that by nothing
has he been so touchingly reminded of the benevolence
of Deity as by the quiet happiness of the infant on its
mother's breast. To myself there is naught in all Nature's
beautiful circle which speaks a richer eloquence of praise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
to the goodness of our God than the gushing joyousness
of the forest-bird!</p>

<p>All day I continued my journey over hill and [110] dale,
creek and ravine, woodland and prairie, until, near sunset,
I reined up my weary animal to rest a while beneath
the shade of a broad-boughed oak by the wayside, of whose
refreshing hospitality an emigrant, with wagon and family,
had already availed himself. The leader of the caravan,
rather a young man, was reclining upon the bank,
and, according to his own account, none the better for an
extra dram. From a few remarks which were elicited from
him, I soon discovered&mdash;what I had suspected, but which
he at first had seemed doggedly intent upon concealing&mdash;that
he belonged to that singular sect to which I have
before alluded, styling themselves Mormonites, and that he
was even then on his way to Mount Zion, Jackson county,
Mo.! By contriving to throw into my observations a few
of those tenets of the sect which, during my wanderings,
I had gathered up, the worthy Mormonite was soon persuaded&mdash;pardon
my insincerity, reader&mdash;that he had
stumbled upon a veritable brother; and, without reserve
or mental reservation, laid open to my cognizance, as we
journeyed along, "the reasons of the faith that was in him,"
and the ultimate, proximate, and intermediate designs of
the <i>party</i>. And such a chaotic fanfaronade of nonsense,
absurdity, nay, madness, was an idle curiosity never before
punished with. The most which could be gathered of any
possible "<i>account</i>" from this confused, disconnected mass
of rubbish, was the following: That Joe Smith, or Joe
Smith's father, or the devil, or some other great personage,
had somewhere dug up the golden [111] plates upon which
were graven the "Book of Mormon:" that this all-mysterious
and much-to-be-admired book embraced the chronicles of the
lost kings of Israel: that it derived its cognomen from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Mormon, its principal hero, son of Lot's daughter, king of
the Moabites: that Christ was crucified on the spot where
Adam was interred: that the descendants of Cain were
all now under the curse, and no one could possibly designate
who they were: that the Saviour was about to descend
in Jackson county, Missouri; the millennium was dawning,
and that all who were not baptized by Joe Smith or his
compeers, and forthwith repaired to Mount Zion, Missouri,
aforesaid, would assuredly be cut off, and that without
remedy. These may, perhaps, serve as a specimen of a
host of wild absurdities which fell from the lips of my Mormonite;
but, the instant argument upon any point was
pressed, away was he a thousand miles into the fields of
mysticism; or he laid an immediate embargo on farther
proceedings by a barefaced <i>petitio principii</i> on the faith of
the golden plates; or by asserting that the stranger knew
more upon the matter than he! At length the stranger,
coming to the conclusion that he could at least boast as
<i>much</i> of Mormonism, he spurred up, and left the man
still jogging onward, to Mount Zion. And yet, reader,
with all his nonsense, my Mormonite was by no means an
ignorant fanatic. He was a native of Virginia, and for
fifteen years had been a pedagogue west of the Blue Ridge,
from which edifying profession he had at length been [112]
enticed by the eloquence of sundry preachers who had held
forth in his schoolhouse. Thereupon taking to himself a
brace of wives and two or three braces of children by way
of stock in trade for the community at Mount Zion, and
having likewise taken to himself a one-horse wagon, into
which were bestowed the moveables, not forgetting a certain
big-bellied stone bottle which hung ominously dangling
in the rear; I say, having done this, and having, moreover,
pressed into service a certain raw-boned, unhappy-looking
horse, and a certain fat, happy-looking cow, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
driven along beside the wagon, away started he all agog
for the promised land.</p>

<p>The grand tabernacle of these fanatics is said to be at
a place they call <i>Kirtland</i>, upon the shores of Lake Erie,
some twenty miles from Cleveland, and numbers no less
than four thousand persons. Their leader is Joe Smith,
and associated with him is a certain shrewd genius named
Sydney Rigdom, a quondam preacher of the doctrine of
Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_209_212" id="FNanchor_209_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_212" class="fnanchor">209</a> Under the control of these worthies as president
and cashier, a banking-house was established, which
issued about $150,000, and then deceased. The private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
residences are small, but the temple is said to be an elegant
structure of stone, three stories in height, and nearly
square in form. Each of its principal apartments is
calculated to contain twelve hundred persons, and has six
pulpits arranged gradatim, three at each extremity of
the "Aaronic priesthood," and in the same manner with
the "priesthood of Melchisedek." The [113] slips are so
constructed as to permit the audience to face either pulpit
at pleasure. In the highest seat of the "Aaronic priesthood"
sits the venerable sire of the prophet, and below sit his
hopeful Joe and Joe's prime minister, Sydney Rigdom.
The attic of the temple is occupied for schoolrooms, five
in number, where a large number of students are taught
the various branches of the English, Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew languages. The estimated cost of this building
is $60,000.<a name="FNanchor_210_213" id="FNanchor_210_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_213" class="fnanchor">210</a> Smith is represented as a quiet, placid-seeming
knave, with passionless features, perfectly composed
in the midst of his heterogeneous multitude of
dupes. Rigdom, on the contrary, has a face full of fire,
a fine tenour voice, and a mild and persuasive eloquence
of speech. Many of their followers are said to be excellent
men. The circumstances of the origin, rise, and
progress of this singular sect have been given to the
public by the pen of an eccentric but polished writer,
and there is nothing material to add.</p>

<p>The close of the day found me once more upon the banks
of the Kaskaskia; and early on the succeeding morning,
fording the stream, I pursued my route along the great
national road towards Terre Haute. This road is projected
eighty feet in breadth, with a central carriage-path of thirty
feet, elevated above all standing water, and in no instance
to exceed three degrees from a perfect level. The work
has been commenced along the whole [114] line, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
under various stages of advancement; for most of the way
it is perfectly <i>direct</i>. The bridges are to be of limestone,
and of massive structure, the base of the abutments being
equal in depth to one third their altitude. The work was
for a while suspended, for the purpose of investigating
former operations, and subsequently through failure of an
appropriation from Congress; but a grant has since been
voted sufficient to complete the undertaking so far as it
is now projected.<a name="FNanchor_211_214" id="FNanchor_211_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_214" class="fnanchor">211</a> West of Vandalia the route is not
yet located, though repeated surveys with reference to this
object have been made. St. Louis, Alton, Beardstown,
and divers other places upon the Mississippi and its
branches present claims to become the favoured point of
its destination. Upon this road I journeyed some
miles; and, even in its present unfinished condition, it
gives evidence of its enormous character. Compare this
grand national work with the crumbling relics of the
mound-builders scattered over the land, and remark the
contrast: yet how, think you, reader, would an hundred
thousand men regard an undertaking like this?</p>

<p>My route at length, to my regret, struck off at right
angles from the road, and for many a mile wound away
among woods and creeks. As I rode along through the
country I was somewhat surprised at meeting people from
various quarters, who seemed to be gathering to some
rendezvous, all armed with rifles, and with the paraphernalia
of hunting suspended from their shoulders. At
length, near noon, I passed a log-cabin, around which [115]
were assembled about a hundred men: and, upon inquiry,
learned that they had come together for the purpose of
"shooting a beeve,"<a name="FNanchor_212_215" id="FNanchor_212_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_215" class="fnanchor">212</a> as the marksmen have it. The
regulations I found to be chiefly these: A bull's-eye, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a centre nail, stands at a distance variously of from forty
to seventy yards; and those five who, at the close of the
contest, have most frequently <i>driven the nail</i>, are entitled
to a fat ox divided into five portions. Many of the marksmen
in the vicinity, I was informed, could drive the nail
twice out of every three trials. Reluctantly I was forced
to decline a civil invitation to join the party, and to leave
before the sport commenced; but, jogging leisurely along
through a beautiful region of prairie and woodland interspersed,
I reached near nightfall the village of Salem.<a name="FNanchor_213_216" id="FNanchor_213_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_216" class="fnanchor">213</a>
This place, with its dark, weather-beaten edifices, forcibly
recalled to my mind one of those gloomy little seaports
sprinkled along the iron-bound coast of New-England,
over some of which the ocean-storm has roared and the
ocean-eagle shrieked for more than two centuries. The
town is situated on the eastern border of the Grand Prairie,
upon the stage-route from St. Louis to Vincennes; and, as
approached from one quarter, is completely concealed by
a bold promontory of timber springing into the plain. It
is a quiet, innocent, gossiping little place as ever was, no
doubt; never did any harm in all its life, and probably
never will do any. This sage conclusion is predicated upon
certain items gathered at the village singing-school; at
which, ever-notable place, the traveller, agreeable to invitation
[116] attended, and carolled away most vehemently
with about a dozen others of either sex, under the cognizance
of a certain worthy personage styled <i>the Major</i>,
whose vocation seemed to be to wander over these parts for
the purpose of "<i>building up</i>" the good people in psalmody.
To say that I was not more surprised than delighted
with the fruits of the honest songster's efforts in Salem,
and that I was, moreover, marvellously edified by the brisk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
airs of the "Missouri Harmony," from whose cheerful
pages operations were performed, surely need not be done;
therefore, prithee reader, question me not.</p>

<p>That distinguished metaphysician Dugald Stewart, in
his treatise upon the "Active and Moral Powers," has,
in the language of my motto, somewhere<a name="FNanchor_214_217" id="FNanchor_214_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_217" class="fnanchor">214</a> observed,
that leisure after continued exertion is a source of happiness
perfect in its kind; and [117] surely, at the moment
I am now writing, my own feelings abundantly testify to
the force of the remark. For more than one month past
have I been urging myself onward from village to village
and from hamlet to hamlet, through woodland, and over
prairie, river, and rivulet, with almost the celerity of an
<i>avant courier</i>, and hardly with closer regard to passing
scenes and events. My purpose, reader, for I may as well
tell you, has been to accomplish, within a portion of time
to some degree limited, a "tour over the prairies" previously
laid out. This, within the prescribed period, I
am now quite certain of fulfilling; and here am I, at
length "taking mine ease in mine inn" at the ancient and
venerable French village Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>It is evening now. The long summer sunset is dying
away in beauty from the heavens; and alone in my chamber
am I gathering up the fragments of events scattered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
along the pathway of the week that is gone. Last evening
at this hour I was entering the town of Pinkneyville, and
my last number left me soberly regaling myself upon the
harmonious <i>vocalities</i> of the sombre little village of Salem.
Here, then, may I well enough resume "the thread of my
discourse."</p>

<p>During my wanderings in Illinois I have more than once
referred to the frequency and violence of the thunder-gusts
by which it is visited. I had travelled not many miles
the morning after leaving Salem when I was assailed by
one of the most terrific storms I remember to have yet
encountered. All the morning the atmosphere had been
most oppressive, [118] the sultriness completely prostrating,
and the livid exhalations quivered along the parched-up
soil of the prairies, as if over the mouth of an enormous
furnace. A gauzy mist of silvery whiteness at length diffused
itself over the landscape; an inky cloud came heaving
up in the northern horizon, and soon the thunder-peal
began to bellow and reverberate along the darkened prairie,
and the great raindrops came tumbling to the ground.
Fortunately, a shelter was at hand; but hardly had the
traveller availed himself of its liberal hospitality, when the
heavens were again lighted up by the sunbeams; the sable
cloud rolled off to the east, and all was beautiful and calm,
as if the angel of desolation in his hurried flight had but
for a moment stooped the shade of his dusky wing, and
had then swept onward to accomplish elsewhere his terrible
bidding. With a reflection like this I was about remounting
to pursue my way, when a prolonged, deafening,
terrible crash&mdash;as if the wild idea of heathen mythology
was indeed about to be realized, and the thunder-car of
Olympian Jove was dashing through the concave above&mdash;caused
me to falter with foot in stirrup, and almost involuntarily
to turn my eye in the direction from which the bolt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
seemed to have burst. A few hundred yards from the
spot on which I stood a huge elm had been blasted by the
lightning; and its enormous shaft towering aloft, torn,
mangled, shattered from the very summit to its base, was
streaming its long ghastly fragments on the blast. The
scene was one startlingly impressive; one of those few
scenes in a man's life the remembrance [119] of which
years cannot wholly efface; which he never <i>forgets</i>. As I
gazed upon this giant forest-son, which the lapse of centuries
had perhaps hardly sufficed to rear to perfection,
now, even though a ruin, noble, that celebrated passage
of the poet Gray, when describing his <i>bard</i>, recurred with
some force to my mind: in this description Gray is supposed
to have had the painting of Raphael at Florence, representing
Deity in the vision of Ezekiel, before him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Loose his beard and hoary hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A ride of a few hours, after the storm had died away,
brought me to the pleasant little town of Mt. Vernon.<a name="FNanchor_215_218" id="FNanchor_215_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_218" class="fnanchor">215</a>
This place is the seat of justice for Jefferson county, and
has a courthouse of brick, decent enough to the eye, to be
sure, but said to have been so miserably constructed that
it is a perilous feat for his honour here to poise the scales.
The town itself is an inconsiderable place, but pleasantly
situated, in the edge of a prairie, if I forget not, and in
every other respect is exactly what every traveller has seen
a dozen times elsewhere in Illinois. Like Shelbyville, it
is chiefly noted for a remarkable spring in its vicinity, said
to be highly medicinal. How this latter item may stand
I know not, but I am quite sure that all of the <i>pure element</i>
it was my own disagreeable necessity to partake of during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
my brief tarry savoured mightily of medicine or of something
akin. Epsom salts and alum seemed the chief substances
in solution; and with these minerals all the water
in the region appeared heavily charged.</p>

<p>[120] It was a misty, miserable morning when I left Mt. Vernon;
and as my route lay chiefly through a dense timbered
tract, the dank, heavy atmosphere exhaling from the soil,
from the luxuriant vegetation, and from the dense foliage of
the over-hanging boughs, was anything but agreeable. To
endure the pitiless drenching of a summer-shower with
equanimity demands but a brief exercise of stoicism: but
it is not in the nature of man amiably to withstand the
equally pitiless <i>drenching</i> of a drizzling, penetrating, everlasting
fog, be it of sea origin or of land. At length a
thunder-gust&mdash;the usual remedy for these desperate
cases in Illinois&mdash;dissipated the vapour, and the glorious
sunlight streamed far and wide athwart a broad prairie, in
the edge of which I stood. The route was, in the language
of my director, indeed a <i>blind</i> one; but, having received
special instructions thereupon, I hesitated not to press
onward over the swelling, pathless plain towards the <i>east</i>.
After a few miles, having crossed an arm of the prairie,
directions were again sought and received, by which the
route became due <i>south</i>, pathless as before, and through
a tract of woodland rearing itself from a bog perfectly
Serbonian. "Muddy Prairie" indeed. On every side rose
the enormous shafts of the cypress, the water-oak, and
the maple, flinging from their giant branches that gray,
pensile, parasitical moss, which, weaving its long funereal
fibres into a dusky mantle, almost entangles in the
meshes the thin threads of sunlight struggling down from
above. It was here for the first time that I met in any
considerable numbers [121] with that long-necked, long-legged,
long-toed, long-tailed gentry called wild-turkeys:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
and, verily, here was a host ample to atone for all former
deficiency, parading in ungainly magnificence through the
forest upon every side, or peeping curiously down, with
outstretched necks and querulous piping, from their lofty
perches on the traveller below. It is by a skilful imitation
of this same piping, to say nothing of the melodious
gobble that always succeeds it, that the sportsman decoys
these sentimental bipeds within his reach. The same
method is sometimes employed in hunting the deer&mdash;an
imitated bleating of the fawn when in distress&mdash;thus
taking away the gentle mother's life through the medium
of her most generous impulses; a most diabolical <i>modus
operandi</i>, reader, permit me to say.</p>

<p>Emerging at length, by a circuitous path, once more
upon the prairie, instructions were again sought for the
<i>direct</i> route to Pinkneyville, and a course nearly <i>north</i> was
now pointed out. Think of that; <i>east</i>, <i>south</i>, <i>north</i>, in
regular succession too, over a tract of country perfectly
uniform, in order to run a <i>right</i> line between two given
points! This was past all endurance. To a moral certainty
with me, the place of my destination lay away just
southwest from the spot on which I was then standing.
Producing, therefore, my pocket-map and pocket-compass,
by means of a little calculation I had soon laid down the
prescribed course, determined to pursue none other, the
remonstrances, and protestations, and objurgations of men,
women, and children to the contrary notwithstanding.
Pushing [122] boldly forth into the prairie, I had not
travelled many miles when I struck a path leading off in
the direction I had chosen, and which <i>proved</i> the direct
route to Pinkneyville! Thus had I been forced to cross,
recross, and cross again, a prairie miles in breadth, and
to flounder through a swamp other miles in extent, to say
nothing of the <i>depth</i>, and all because of the utter igno<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>rance
of the worthy souls who took upon them <i>to direct</i>.
I have given this instance in detail for the special edification
and benefit of all future wayfarers in Illinois. The
only unerring guide on the prairies is the map and the
compass. Half famished, and somewhat more than half
vexed at the adventures of the morning, I found myself,
near noon, at the cabin-door of an honest old Virginian,
and was ere long placed in a fair way to relieve my craving
appetite. With the little compass which hung at the
safety-riband of my watch, and which had done me such
rare service during my wanderings, the worthy old gentleman
seemed heart-stricken at first sight, and warmly
protested that he and the "<i>stranger</i>" must have "<i>a small
bit of a tug</i>" for that <i>fixen</i>, a proposition which said
stranger by no means as warmly relished. Laying, therefore,
before the old farmer a slight outline of my morning's
ramble, he readily perceived that with me the "<i>pretty leetle
fixen</i>" was anything but a superlative. My evening ride
was a delightful one along the edge of an extended prairie;
but, though repeatedly assured by the worthy settlers
upon the route that I could "<i>catch no diffick</i>ulty on my
way no how," my compass was [123] my only safe guide.
At length, crossing "Mud River" upon a lofty bridge of
logs, the town of Pinkneyville was before me just at
sunset.<a name="FNanchor_216_219" id="FNanchor_216_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_219" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>Pinkneyville has but little to commend it to the passing
traveller, whether we regard beauty of location, regularity
of structure, elegance, size, or proportion of edifices, or
the cultivation of the farms in its vicinage. It would,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
perhaps, be a pleasant town enough were its site more elevated,
its buildings larger, and disposed with a little more
of mathematical exactness, or its streets less lanelike and
less filthy. As it is, it will require some years to give it a
standing among its fellows. It is laid out on the roll of
a small prairie of moderate fertility, but has quite an extensive
settlement of enterprising farmers, a circumstance
which will conduce far more to the ultimate prosperity of
the place. The most prominent structure is a blood-red
jail of brick, standing near the centre of the village; rather
a savage-looking concern, and, doubtless, so designed by
its sagacious architect for the purpose of frightening evil
doers.</p>

<p>Having taken these <i>observations</i> from the tavern door
during twilight, the traveller retired to his chamber, nothing
loath, after a ride of nearly fifty miles, to bestow his tired
frame to rest. But, alas! that verity compels him to declare
it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis true, and pity 'tis 'tis true,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">the "<i>Traveller's Inn</i>" was anything, nay, <i>every</i>thing but
the comfort-giving spot the hospitable cognomen swinging
from its signpost seemed to imply. Ah! the fond
visions of quietude and repose, [124] of plentiful feeding
and hearty sleeping, which those magic words, "<i>Traveller's
Inn</i>," had conjured up in the weary traveller's fancy when
they first delightfully swung before his eye.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But human pleasure, what art thou, in sooth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The torrent's smoothness ere it dash below!!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Well&mdash;exhausted, worn down, tired out, the traveller yet
found it as utterly impossible quietly to rest, as does, doubtless,
"a half-assoilzed soul in purgatory;" and, hours before
the day had begun to break, he arose and ordered out his
horse. Kind reader, hast ever, in the varyings of thy pilgrimage
through this troublous world of ours, when faint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
and languid, and weary with exertion, by any untoward
circumstance, been forced to resist the gentle promptings
of "quiet nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep," and to
count away the tedious hours of the livelong night till thy
very existence became a burden to thee; till thy brain
whirled and thy nerves twanged like the tense harp-string?
And didst thou not, then&mdash;didst thou not, from the very
depths of thy soul, assever this ill, of all ills mortality is
heir to, that one most utterly and unutterably intolerable
patiently to endure? 'Tis no very pitiful thing, sure, to
consume the midnight taper, "sickly" though it be: we
commiserate the sacrifice, but we fail not to appreciate the
reward. Around the couch of suffering humanity, who
could not outwatch the stars? the recompense is not of
<i>this</i> world.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "When youth and pleasure meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chase the glowing hours with flying feet,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt"><i>who</i> asks for "sleep till morn!" But when in weariness
[125] of the flesh and in languidness of spirit, the overspent
wayfarer has laid down his wearied frame to rest for the
toils of the morrow, it is indeed a <i>bitter</i> thing rudely to have
that rest broken up! "The sleep of the <i>wayfaring</i> man
is sweet," and to have that slumber obtruded upon by
causes too contemptible for a thought, is not in nature
with equanimity to bear! Besides, the luckless sufferer
meets with no <i>commiseration</i>: it is a matter all too ludicrous
for pity; and as for fortitude, and firmness, and the like,
what warrior ever achieved a laurel in such a war? what
glory is to be gained over a host of starving&mdash;but I forbear.
You are pretty well aware, kind reader, or ought to
be, that the situation of your traveller just then was anything
but an enviable one. Not so, however, deemed the
worthy landlord on this interesting occasion. His blank
bewilderment of visage may be better imagined than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
described, as, aroused from sleep, his eye met the vision
of his stranger guest; while the comic amalgamation of
distress and pique in the marvellously elongated features
of the fair hostess was so truly laughable, that a smile
flitted along the traveller's rebellious muscles, serving completely
to disturb the serenity of her breast! The good
lady was evidently not a little nettled at the <i>apparent</i> mirthfulness
of her guest under his manifold miseries&mdash;I do
assure thee, reader, the mirthfulness was only <i>apparent</i>&mdash;and
did not neglect occasion thereupon to let slip a sly
remark impugning his "gentle breeding," because, forsooth,
dame Nature, in throwing together her "cunning workmanship,"
had gifted it with a [126] nervous system not
quite of steel. Meanwhile, the honest publican, agreeable
to orders, having brought forth the horse, with folded hands
all meekly listened to the eloquence of his spouse; but the
good man was meditating the while a retaliation in shape
of a most unconscionable bill of cost, which was soon presented
and was as soon discharged. Then, leaving the
interesting pair to their own cogitations, with the very
<i>top</i> of the morning the traveller flung himself upon his
horse and was soon out of sight.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">1</span></a> George D. Prentice (1802-70), founder of the Louisville <i>Journal</i>, was graduated
from Brown University in 1823. Two years later he became editor of the
Connecticut <i>Mirror</i> and in 1828-30 had charge of the <i>New England Weekly Review</i>.
In the spring of 1830, at the earnest solicitation of several influential Connecticut
Whigs, he went West to gather data for a life of Henry Clay. Once in Kentucky
he threw all the force of his political genius in support of Clay's policy.
On November 24, 1830, he issued the first number of the Louisville <i>Journal</i>, which through
his able management was soon recognized as the chief Whig organ in the West.
Wholly devoted to Clay's cause, its own reputation rose and declined with that
of its champion. The <i>Journal</i> maintained an existence till 1868, when Henry
Watterson consolidated it with the Courier, under the title of <i>Courier-Journal</i>.
Prentice is reputed to have been the originator of the short, pointed paragraph in
journalism. His <i>Life of Henry Clay</i> (Hartford, 1831) is well known. In 1859
he published a collection of poems under the name <i>Prenticeana</i> (New York).
It was reprinted in 1870 with a biography of the author by G. W. Griffin
(Philadelphia).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

After nine years of preaching in Missouri and Illinois, he founded (1826) the Rocky
Spring Seminary for training teachers and ministers. It is said that he travelled
more than six thousand miles collecting money for endowing this school. In 1828
Peck began publishing the <i>Western Pioneer</i>, the first official organ of the Baptist
church in the West, and served as the corresponding secretary and financial agent of
the American Baptist Publication Society from 1843 to 1845. He died at Rocky
Springs, Illinois, in 1858. Peck made important contributions to the publications of
the early historical societies in the Northwest. His chief independent works are:
<i>A Guide for Emigrants</i> (Boston, 1831), republished as <i>A New Guide for Emigrants</i>
(Boston, 1836); <i>Gazetteer of Illinois</i> (Jacksonville, 1834 and 1837); <i>Father Clark or
the Pioneer Preacher</i> (New York, 1855); and "Life of Daniel Boone," in Jared
Sparks, <i>American Biography</i>.

Judge James Hall was born in Philadelphia (1793), and died near Cincinnati
in 1868. He was a member of the Washington Guards during the War of 1812-15,
was promoted to the 2nd United States artillery, and accompanied Decatur on his
expedition to Algiers (1815). Resigning in 1818, he practiced law at Shawneetown,
Illinois (1820-27), and filled the office of public prosecutor and judge of the circuit
court. He moved to Vandalia (1827) and began editing the <i>Illinois Intelligencer</i>
and the <i>Illinois Monthly Magazine</i>. From 1836 to 1853 he was president of the
commercial bank at Cincinnati, and acted as state treasurer. He published: <i>Letters
from the West</i> (London, 1828); <i>Legends of the West</i> (1832); <i>Memoirs of the
Public Services of General William Henry Harrison</i> (Philadelphia, 1836); <i>Sketches
of History, Life and Manners of the West</i> (Philadelphia, 1835); <i>Statistics of the
West at the Close of 1836</i> (Cincinnati, 1836); <i>Notes on the Western States</i> (Philadelphia,
1838); <i>History and Biography of the Indians of North America</i> (3 volumes,
1838-44); <i>The West, its Soil, Surface, etc.</i> (Cincinnati, 1848); <i>The West, its Commerce

Major Alphonso Wetmore (1793-1849) was of much less importance as a writer
on Western history than those above mentioned. He entered the 23rd infantry
in 1812, and subsequently was transferred to the 6th. He served as paymaster
for his regiment from 1815 to 1821, and was promoted to a captaincy (1819). In
1816 he moved with his family to Franklinton, Missouri, and later practiced law
in St. Louis. His chief contribution to Western travel is a <i>Gazetteer of Missouri</i>
(St. Louis, 1837).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

spring of 1780 were: Falls of the Ohio, Linnis, Sullivan's Old, Hoagland's, Floyd's,
Spring, and Middle stations. Beargrass Creek, a small stream less than ten miles
in length, flows in a northwestern trend and uniting with two smaller creeks, South
and Muddy forks, enters the Ohio (not the Mississippi) immediately above the
Falls of the Ohio (Louisville).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_8" id="Footnote_6_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_8"><span class="label">6</span></a> It is only at high stages of the river that boats even of a smaller class can pass
over the Falls. At other times they go through the "Louisville and Portland
Canal." In 1804 the Legislature of Kentucky incorporated a company to cut a
canal around the falls. Nothing effectual, however, beyond surveys, was done
until 1825, when on the 12th of January of that year the Louisville and Portland
Canal Company was incorporated by an act of the legislature, with a capital
of $600,000, in shares of $100 each, with perpetual succession. 3665 of the
shares of the company are in the hands of individuals, about seventy in number,
residing in the following states: New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, New-York,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Kentucky, and Missouri, and 2335 shares belong
to the government of the United States.
</p><p>
In December, 1825, contracts were entered into to complete the work of this
canal within two years, for about $375,000, and under these contracts the work
was commenced in March, 1826. Many unforeseen difficulties retarded the work
until the close of the year 1828. At this time the contractors failed; new contracts
were made at advanced prices, and the canal was finally opened for navigation
December 5th, 1830. When completed it cost about $750,000. Owing to the
advanced season at which it was opened, the deposites of alluvial earth at the
lower extremity of the canal, or debouchure, could not be removed; and also from
the action of the floods during the succeeding severe winter on the stones that had
been temporarily deposited on the sides of the canal, causing them to be precipitated
into the canal, it was not used to the extent that it otherwise would have
been. During the year 1831, 406 steamboats, 46 keelboats, and 357 flatboats,
measuring 76,323 tons, passed through the locks, which are about one fourth the
number that would have passed if all the obstructions had been removed.
</p><p>
The Louisville and Portland Canal is about two miles in length; is intended
for steamboats of the largest class, and to overcome a fall of 24 feet, occasioned
by an irregular ledge of limerock, through which the entire bed of the canal is
excavated, a part of it, to the depth of 12 feet, is overlaid with earth. There
is one guard and three lift locks combined, all of which have their foundation on
the rock. One bridge of stone 240 feet long, with an elevation of 68 feet to top of
the parapet wall, and three arches, the centre one of which is semi-elliptical, with
a transverse diameter of 66, and a semi-conjugate diameter of 22 feet. The two
side arches are segments of 40 feet span. The guard lock is 190 feet long in
the clear, with semicircular heads of 26 feet in diameter, 50 feet wide, and 42 feet
high, and contains 21,775 perches of mason-work. The solid contents of this
lock are equal to 15 common locks, such as are built on the Ohio and New-York
canals. The lift locks are of the same width with the guard lock, 20 feet high,
and 183 feet long in the clear, and contain 12,300 perches of mason-work. The
entire length of the walls, from the head of the guard lock to the end of the outlet
lock, is 921 feet. In addition to the amount of mason-work above, there are three
culverts to drain off the water from the adjacent lands, the mason-work of which,
when added to the locks and bridge, give the whole amount of mason-work
41,989 perches, equal to about 30 common canal locks. The cross section of the
canal is 200 feet at top of banks, 50 feet at bottom, and 42 feet high, having a
capacity equal to that of 25 common canals; and if we keep in view the unequal
quantity of mason-work compared to the length of the canal, the great difficulties
of excavating earth and rock from so great a depth and width, together with the
contingencies attending its construction from the fluctuations of the Ohio River,
it may not be considered as extravagant in drawing the comparison between the
work in this and in that of 70 or 75 miles of common canalling.
</p><p>
In the upper sections of the canal, the alluvial earth to the average depth of
twenty feet being removed, trunks of trees were found more or less decayed, and
so imbedded as to indicate a powerful current towards the present shore, some
of which were cedar, which is not now found in this region. Several <i>fireplaces</i>
of a rude construction, with partially burnt wood, were discovered near the rock,
as well as the bones of a variety of small animals and several human skeletons;
rude implements formed of bone and stone were frequently seen, as also several
well-wrought specimens of hematite of iron, in the shape of plummets or sinkers,
displaying a knowledge in the arts far in advance of the present race of Indians.
</p><p>
The first stratum of rock was a light, friable slate, in close contact with the
limestone, and difficult to disengage from it; this slate did not, however, extend
over the whole surface of the rock, and was of various thicknesses, from three
inches to four feet.
</p><p>
The stratum next to the slate was a close, compact limestone, in which petrified
seashells and an infinite variety of coralline formations were imbedded, and frequent
cavities of crystalline incrustations were seen, many of which still contained
petroleum of a highly fetid smell, which gives the name to this description of
limestone. This description of rock is on an average of five feet, covering a substratum
of a species of cias limestone of a bluish colour, imbedding nodules of
hornstone and organic remains. The fracture of this stone has in all instances
been found to be irregularly conchoidal, and on exposure to the atmosphere
and subjection to fire, it crumbles to pieces. When burnt and ground, and mixed
with a due proportion of silicious sand, it has been found to make a most superior
kind of hydraulic cement or water-lime.
</p><p>
The discovery of this valuable limestone has enabled the canal company to
construct their masonry more solidly than any other known in the United States.
</p><p>
A manufactory of this hydraulic cement or water-lime is now established
on the bank of the canal, on a scale capable of supplying the United States with
this much-valued material for all works in contact with water or exposed to moisture;
the nature of this cement being to harden in the water; the grout used on
the locks of the canal is already <i>harder</i> than the <i>stone</i> used in their construction.
</p><p>
After passing through the stratum which was commonly called the water-lime,
about ten feet in thickness, the workmen came to a more compact mass
of primitive gray limestone, which, however, was not penetrated to any great
depth. In many parts of the excavation masses of a bluish white flint and hornstone
were found enclosed in or incrusting the fetid limestone. And from the
large quantities of arrow-heads and other rude formations of this flint stone, it
is evident that it was made much use of by the Indians in forming their weapons
for war and hunting; in one place a magazine of arrow-heads was discovered,
containing many hundreds of these rude implements, carefully packed together
and buried below the surface of the ground.
</p><p>
The existence of iron ore in considerable quantities was exhibited in the progress
of the excavation of the canal, by numerous highly-charged chalybeate springs
that gushed out, and continued to flow during the time that the rock was exposed,
chiefly in the upper strata of limestone.&mdash;<i>Louisville Directory for

freight boat operating on the Ohio. In 1814 he ran the gauntlet of the British
batteries at New Orleans, and carried supplies to Fort St. Phillip. The following
year, in charge of the "Enterprise" he made the first successful steamboat trip
from New Orleans to Louisville. Later he constructed the "Washington," making
many improvements on the Fulton model. Fulton and Livingstone brought suit
against him but lost in the action. May 24, 1824, at the instigation of J. C. Calhoun,
then secretary of war, Congress appropriated seventy-five thousand dollars (not
$105,000, as Flagg says) for the purpose of removing obstructions from the
Ohio and Mississippi rivers. As early as 1821, Shreve had invented a device
for removing snags and sawyers from river beds. But it was not until after two
years' fruitless trials with a scheme devised by John Bruce of Kentucky, that Barbour,
at Calhoun's suggestion, appointed Shreve superintendent of improvements
on Western rivers (December 10, 1826). This position he held until September
11, 1841, when he was dismissed for political reasons. In the face of discouraging
opposition Shreve constructed (1829) with government aid the snagboat
"Heleopolis" with which he later wrought a marvellous improvement in navigation
on the Ohio and Mississippi. From 1833 to 1838 he was engaged in removing
the Red River "raft" for a distance of a hundred and sixty miles, thus opening
that important river for navigation. For a good biography of Shreve, see the
<i>Democratic Review</i>, xxii (New York, 1848), pp. 159-171, 241-251. A fair estimate
of the importance of his work can be gained from the following statistics; from
1822-27 the loss from snags alone, of property on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,
including steam and flat-boats and their cargoes, amounted to $1,362,500; the like
loss from 1827-32 was reduced to $381,000, although the volume of business had
greatly increased.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

(100 tons), at Wheeling in 1835. It is reported that from 1831 to 1833, of the
sixty-six steamboats which went out of service, twenty-four were snagged, fifteen
burned, and five destroyed by collision with other boats. See James Hall, <i>Notes

broad at beam, with a keel extending from bow to stern, and had a draft
of twenty to thirty inches. When descending the stream, the force of the current,
with occasional aid from the pole, was the usual mode of locomotion. In ascending
the stream, however, sails, poles, and almost every known device were used;
not infrequently the vessel was towed by from twenty to forty men, with a rope
several hundred feet in length attached to the mast. These boats were built in
Pittsburg at a cost of two to three thousand dollars each.
</p><p>
The barge was constructed for narrow, shallow water. As a rule it was larger
than the keel-boat; but of less draft, and afforded greater accommodations for
passengers.
</p><p>
Broad-horn was a term generally applied to the Mississippi and Ohio flat-boat,
which made its advent on the Western waters later than the barge or the keel-boat.
It was a large, unwieldy structure, with a perfectly flat bottom, perpendicular sides,
and usually covered its entire length. It was used only for descending the stream.

"The earliest improvement upon the canoe was the pirogue, an invention of
the whites. Like the canoe, this is hewed out of the solid log; the difference is,
that the pirogue has greater width and capacity, and is composed of several pieces
of timbers&mdash;as if the canoe was sawed lengthwise into two equal sections, and a
broad flat piece of timber inserted in the middle, so as to give greater breadth of
beam to the vessel." Hall, <i>Notes on the Western States</i>, p. 218.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

the Ohio River by way of the Maumee and Wabash rivers, has played an active
r&ocirc;le in the development of Indiana, her most important cities being located
upon its route. The Ohio section was constructed during the years 1837-43, and
the Indiana section as far as Lafayette in 1832-40; the canal being later continued
to Terre Haute and the Ohio River near Evansville. Although the federal government
granted Indiana 1,505,114 acres for constructing the canal, the state was
by this work plunged heavily in debt. After the War of Secession the canal lost
much of its relative importance for commerce. June 14, 1880, Congress authorized
the secretary of war to order a survey and estimate of cost and practicability of
making a ship canal out of the old Wabash and Erie Canal. The survey and
estimate were made, but the matter was allowed to drop. See <i>Senate Docs.</i>, 46

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_43" id="Footnote_41_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_43"><span class="label">41</span></a>  Since the remarks relative to "the remarkable cavern in the vicinity of <i>Tower
Rock</i>, and not far from Hurricane Island," were in type, the subjoined notice of a
similar cave, probably the same referred to, has casually fallen under my observation.
The reader will recognise in this description the outlines of <i>Rock-Inn-Cave</i>,
previously noticed. It is not a little singular that none of our party, which was
a numerous one, observed the "hieroglyphics" here alluded to. The passage is
from Priest's "American Antiquities."
</p><p>
"<i>A Cavern of the West, in which are found many interesting Hieroglyphics, supposed
to have been made by the Ancient Inhabitants.</i>
</p><p>
"On the Ohio, twenty miles below the mouth of the Wabash, is a cavern in
which are found many hieroglyphics and representations of such delineations as
would induce the belief that their authors were indeed comparatively refined
and civilized. It is a cave in a rock, or ledge of the mountain, which presents
itself to view a little above the water of the river when in flood, and is situated
close to the bank. In the early settlement of Ohio this cave became possessed by
a party of Kentuckians called 'Wilson's Gang.' Wilson, in the first place, brought
his family to this cave, and fitted it up as a spacious dwelling; erected a <i>signpost</i>
on the water side, on which were these words: 'Wilson's Liquor Vault and House
of Entertainment.' The novelty of such a tavern induced almost all the boats descending
the river to call for refreshments and amusement. Attracted by these
circumstances, several idle characters took up their abode at the cave, after which
it continually resounded with the shouts of the licentious, the clamour of the riotous,
and the blasphemy of gamblers. Out of such customers Wilson found no difficulty
in forming a band of robbers, with whom he formed the plan of murdering the
crews of every boat that stopped at his tavern, and of sending the boats, manned
by some of his party, to New-Orleans, and there sell their loading for cash, which
was to be conveyed to the cave by land through the States of Tennessee and Kentucky;
the party returning with it being instructed to murder and rob on all good
occasions on the road.
</p><p>
"After a lapse of time the merchants of the upper country began to be alarmed
on finding their property make no returns, and their people never coming back.
Several families and respectable men who had gone down the river were never heard
of, and the losses became so frequent that it raised, at length, a cry of individual
distress and general dismay. This naturally led to an inquiry, and large rewards
were offered for the discovery of the perpetrators of such unparalleled crimes. It
soon came out that Wilson, with an organized party of forty-five men, was the
cause of such waste of blood and treasure; that he had a station at Hurricane
Island to arrest every boat that passed by the mouth of the cavern, and that he
had agents at Natchez and New-Orleans, of presumed respectability, who converted
his assignments into cash, though they knew the goods to be stolen or
obtained by the commission of murder.
</p><p>
"The publicity of Wilson's transactions soon broke up his party; some
dispersed, others were taken prisoners, and he himself was killed by one of his
associates, who was tempted by the reward offered for the head of the captain
of the gang.
</p><p>
"This cavern measures about twelve rods in length and five in width; its entrance
presents a width of eighty feet at its base and twenty-five feet high. The
interior walls are smooth rock. The floor is very remarkable, being level through
the whole length of its centre, the sides rising in stony grades, in the manner of
seats in the pit of a theatre. On a diligent scrutiny of the walls, it is plainly discerned
that the ancient inhabitants at a very remote period had made use of the
cave as a house of deliberation and council. The walls bear many hieroglyphics
well executed, and some of them represent animals which have no resemblance to
any now known to natural history.
</p><p>
"This cavern is a great natural curiosity, as it is connected with another still
more gloomy, which is situated exactly above, united by an aperture of about fourteen
feet, which, to ascend, is like passing up a chimney, while the mountain is
yet far above. Not long after the dispersion and arrest of the robbers who had
infested it, in the upper vault were found the skeletons of about sixty persons, who
had been murdered by the gang of Wilson, as was supposed.
</p><p>
"But the tokens of antiquity are still more curious and important than a
description of the mere cave, which are found engraved on the sides within, an
account of which we proceed to give:
</p><p>
"The sun in different stages of rise and declension; the moon under various
phases; a snake biting its tail, and representing an orb or circle; a viper; a vulture;
buzzards tearing out the heart of a prostrate man; a panther held by the ears by
a child; a crocodile; several trees and shrubs; a fox; a curious kind of hydra serpent;
two doves; several bears; two scorpions; an eagle; an owl; some quails; <i>eight</i>
representations of animals which are now unknown. Three out of the eight are
like the elephant in all respects except the tusk and the tail. Two more resemble
the tiger; one a wild boar; another a sloth; and the last appears a creature of
fancy, being a quadruman instead of a quadruped; the claws being alike before
and behind, and in the act of conveying something to the mouth, which lay in the
centre of the monster. Besides these were several fine representations of men and
women, <i>not naked</i>, but clothed; not as the Indians, but much in the costume of
Greece and Rome."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flagg.</span>

The scheme known as the "Internal Improvement Policy" was authorized
over the governor's veto by the Illinois general assembly on February 27, 1837,
in response to the popular clamor for its adoption. The object was to open the
country for immigration and hasten its natural development by constructing railroads
and canals as yet not needed commercially. Ten million two hundred
thousand dollars were appropriated by the act, including two hundred thousand
dollars to be given directly to the counties not favored. Surveys were made, and
speculation was rife. Then followed a collapse, and six million five hundred thousand
dollars were added to the state debt. The scheme was later referred to as
the General Insanity Bill.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

an object of much dread to boatmen during the days of early navigation on the
Mississippi. A powerful current sweeping around Devil's Oven, frequently seized
frail or unwieldy craft to dash it against this rock. Usually the boatmen landed,

According to Austin, cited below, La Motte (or La Mothe) Cadillac, governor
of Louisiana, went on an expedition (1715) to the Illinois in search of silver, and
found lead ore in a mine which had been shown him fifteen miles west of the Mississippi.
It is believed by some authorities that this was the famous "Mine la
Mothe," at the head of the St. Francis River. Schoolcraft, however, says that
Philip Francis Renault, having received mining grants from the French government,
left France in 1719, ascended the Mississippi, established himself the following
year near Kaskaskia, and sent out small companies in search of precious metals;
and that La Mothe, who had charge of one of these companies, soon discovered
the mine that still bears his name. It was operated only at intervals, until after
the American occupation, when its resources were developed. Under the Spanish
domination (1762-1800), little was done to develop the mine. In 1763, however,
Francis Burton discovered the "Mine &agrave; Burton," on a branch of Mineral Fork.
Like the "Mine la Mothe," it was known to the Indians before the discovery by
the whites, and both are still operated. Burton was said to have been alive in
1818, at the age of a hundred and six; see Colonel Thomas Benton's account of
him in St. Louis <i>Enquirer</i>, October 16, 1818.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69_71" id="Footnote_69_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_71"><span class="label">69</span></a> The following extract from the Journal of Charlevoix, one of the earliest historians
of the West, with reference to the Mines upon the Merrimac, may prove
not uninteresting. The work is a rare one.
</p><p>
"On the 17th (Oct., 1721), after sailing five leagues farther, I left, on my right,
the river Marameg, where they are at present employed in searching for a silver
mine. Perhaps your grace may not be displeased if I inform you what success
may be expected from this undertaking. Here follows what I have been able to
collect about this affair, from a person who is well acquainted with it, and who
has resided for several years on the spot.
</p><p>
"In the year 1719, the Sieur de Lochon, being sent by the West India Company,
in quality of founder, and having dug in a place which had been marked out to
him, drew up a pretty large quantity of ore, a pound whereof, which took up four
days in smelting, produced, as they say, two drachms of silver; but some have
suspected him of putting in this quantity himself. A few months afterward he
returned thither, and, without thinking any more of the silver, he extracted from
two or three thousand weight of ore fourteen pounds of very bad lead, which stood
him in fourteen hundred francs. Disgusted with a labour which was so unprofitable,
he returned to France.
</p><p>
"The company, persuaded of the truth of the indications which had been given
them, and that the incapacity of the founder had been the sole cause of their bad
success, sent, in his room, a Spaniard called Antonio, who had been taken at the
siege of Pensacola; had afterward been a galley-slave, and boasted much of his
having wrought in a mine at Mexico. They gave him very considerable appointments,
but he succeeded no better than had done the Sieur de Lochon. He was
not discouraged himself, and others inclined to believe that he had failed from his
not being versed in the construction of furnaces. He gave over the search after
lead, and undertook to make silver; he dug down to the rock, which was found
to be eight or ten feet in thickness; several pieces of it were blown up and put into
a crucible, from whence it was given out that he extracted three or four drachms
of silver; but many are still doubtful of the truth of this fact.
</p><p>
"About this time arrived a company of the King's miners, under the direction
of one <i>La Renaudiere</i>, who, resolving to begin with the lead mines, was able to do
nothing; because neither he himself nor any of his company were in the least acquainted
with the construction of furnaces. Nothing can be more surprising than
the facility with which the company at that time exposed themselves to great
expenses, and the little precaution they took to be satisfied of the capacity of those
they employed. La Renaudiere and his miners not being able to procure any lead,
a private company undertook the mines of the Marameg, and Sieur Renault, one
of the directors, superintended them with care. In the month of June last he
found a bed of lead ore two feet in thickness, running to a great length over a chain
of mountains, where he has now set his people to work. He flatters himself that
there is silver below the lead. Everybody is not of his opinion, but will discover
the truth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flagg.</span></p></div>

his <i>Gazetteer of the States of Illinois and Missouri</i> (Albany, 1823), with the exception
that the latter says there were no inscriptions to be found on the gravestones.
Beck himself makes extended quotations from the <i>Missouri Gazette</i>, November 6,
1818, and subsequent numbers. Though no doubt exaggerated, these accounts
were probably based on facts, for a large number of prehistoric remains have been
found in St. Louis County and preserved in the Peabody Museum at New Haven,
Connecticut, and elsewhere.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

On May 20, 1826, Congress made an appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars
to the secretary of war, for the purpose of purchasing the site for the erection of
an arsenal in the vicinity of St. Louis. Lands now far within the southeastern
limits of the city were purchased, and the buildings erected which were used for
arsenals until January 16, 1871, when they were occupied as a depot for the general
mounted recruiting service.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

the West, are annually enlarging, as progress is made in clearing and cultivating
the regions drained by them, scarcely admits a doubt. Within the past thirty years,
the width of the Mississippi has sensibly increased; its overflows are more frequent,
while, by the diminution of obstructions, it would seem not to have become proportionally
shallow. In 1750, the French settlements began upon the river above
New-Orleans, and for twenty years the banks were cultivated without a <i>levee</i>. Inundation
was then a rare occurrence: ever since, from year to year, the river has
continued to rise, and require higher and stronger embankments. A century hence,
if this phenomenon continues, what a magnificent spectacle will not this river present!
How terrific its freshets! The immense forest of timber which lies concealed
beneath its depths, as evinced by the great earthquakes of 1811, demonstrates that,
for centuries, the Mississippi has occupied its present bed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flagg.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_76_78" id="Footnote_76_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_78"><span class="label">76</span></a> In 1764 Auguste Chouteau made tentative plans for the fortification of St.
Louis. In obedience to an order by Don Francisco Cruzat, the lieutenant-governor,
he made a survey in 1781 for the purpose of perfecting these earlier plans.
In the same year the stockade was begun immediately south of the present site of
the courthouse. In 1797 the round stone tower which Flagg mentions was constructed
and preparations made for building four additional towers; the latter were
never completed. From 1804 to 1806 these fortifications were used by the United
States troops, and then abandoned for military purposes. The commandant's
house served as a courthouse from 1806 to 1816; and the tower as a jail until 1819.

Bloody Island, now the Third Ward of East St. Louis, was formed about 1800
by the current cutting its way through the neck in a bend of the river. For a long
time it was not determined to what state it belonged, and being considered neutral
ground many duels were fought there, notably those between Thomas H. Benton
and Charles Lucas (1817), United States District Attorney Thomas Rector and
Joshua Barton (1823), and Thomas Biddle and Spencer Pettis (1830). The

soldiers to St. Louis in 1767. Later, these troops were transferred to the south bank
of the Missouri, a few miles above its mouth, where "Old Fort St. Charles the
Prince" was erected. General Wilkinson built Fort Bellefontaine on this site in
1805. From 1809 to 1815 this was the headquarters of the military department
of Louisiana (including Forts Madison, Massac, Osage, and Vincennes). It was
the starting point of the Pike, Long, and Atkinson expeditions. On July 10, 1826,
it was abandoned for Jefferson Barracks, but a small arsenal of deposits was maintained
here until 1834. The land was eventually sold by the government (1836).

was first built at Alton (1827), but the last prisoner was transferred (1860) to the
new penitentiary at Joliet, begun in 1857. Alton was the scene of the famous anti-Abolitionist

Alton in 1836. The act incorporating the first railroad in Illinois was approved
January 17, 1835; it provided for the construction of a road from Chicago to a point
opposite Vincennes. By the internal improvement act of February 27, 1837, a
road was authorized to be constructed from Alton to Terre Haute, by way of Shelbyville,
and another from Alton to Mount Carmel, by way of Salem, Marion County;
but the act was repealed before the roads were completed. The Cumberland road
was constructed only to Vandalia, Fayette County, though the internal improvement
act contemplated its extension to St. Louis.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

a resident of St. Charles, visited the place, which was then an Indian settlement.
Pleased with the location he returned to St. Charles, and secured a grant of the

organized a colony from among the French inhabitants of St. Charles and St. Louis,
and occupied the place the same autumn.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

stock, and formerly occupied the state to which they gave the name. They were
loyal to the French during their early wars, later aided the English, and were with
great difficulty subdued by the United States government. Separate tribes of the
Illinois Indians were the Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Michigami, Moingewena, Peoria,
and Tamaroa.
</p><p>
On a high bluff just above Alton there was formerly to be seen a huge painted
image known among the Indians as the Piasa Bird. To the natives it was an
object of much veneration, and in time many superstitions became connected therewith.
First described in the <i>Journal</i> of Father Jacques Marquette (1673) its origin
was long a subject of speculation among early writers. Traces of this strange
painting could be seen until 1840 or 1845, when they were entirely obliterated
through quarrying. See P. A. Armstrong, <i>The Piasa or the Devil among the Indians</i>

The version of the tradition given by Flagg was probably from the pen of John
Russell, who in 1837 began editing at Grafton, Illinois, the <i>Backwoodsman</i>, a local
newspaper. Russell had in 1819 or 1820 published in the <i>Missourian</i> an article
entitled "Venomous Worm," which won for him considerable reputation. Russell
admitted that the version was largely imaginative; nevertheless it had a wide

sixty miles southwest of Chicago, on the west bank and near the outlet of Lake
Peoria, an expansion of the Illinois River. Its site was visited in 1680 by La Salle.
Early in the eighteenth century a French settlement was made a mile and a half
farther up, and named Peoria for the local Indian tribe. French missionaries were
in this neighborhood as early as 1673-74. In 1788 or 1789 the first house was built
on the present site of Peoria and by the close of the century the inhabitants of the old
town, because of its more healthful location, moved to the new village of Peoria,
which at first was called La Ville de Maillet, in honor of a French Canadian who
commanded a company of volunteers in the War of the Revolution. Later the
name was changed to its present form. At the opening of the War of 1812-15,
the French inhabitants were charged with having aroused the Indians against the
Americans in Illinois. Governor Ninian Edwards ordered Thomas E. Craig, captain
of a company of Illinois militia, to proceed up the Illinois River and build a
fort at Peoria. Under the pretense that his men had been fired upon by the inhabitants,
when the former were peaceably passing in their boats, Craig burned half
the town of Peoria in November, 1812, and transferred the majority of the population
to below Alton. In the following year, Fort Clark&mdash;named in honor of
General George Rogers Clark&mdash;was erected by General Benjamin Howard on
this site; but after the close of the war the fort was burned by the Indians. After
the affair of 1812, Peoria was not occupied, save occasionally, until 1819, when
it was rebuilt by the Americans. The American Fur Company established a post
there in 1824. See C. Ballance, <i>History of Peoria</i> (Peoria, 1870).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Kearny was sent with companies B, H, and I of the 1st United States dragoons to
establish a fort near the mouth of Des Moines River. The present site of Montrose,
Lee County, Iowa, at the head of the lower rapids of the Mississippi, was
chosen. The barracks being completed by November, 1834, they were occupied
until the spring of 1837, when the troops were transferred to Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas.
</p><p>
As early as 1721 a French fort (La Baye) had been erected at Green Bay, on
the left bank of Fox River, a half league from its mouth. After suffering many
vicissitudes during the Fox wars it was later strengthened, and when occupied by
English troops in 1761, was re-named Fort Edward Augustus. After the close of
the War of 1812-15, the United States government determined to exercise a real
authority over the forts on the upper Great Lakes, where, in spite of the provision
of Jay's Treaty (1794), its power had been merely nominal. In 1815 John Bowyer,
the first United States Indian agent for the Green Bay district, established a
government trading post at Green Bay, and made an ineffectual attempt to control
the fur trade of the region. The following year, Fort Howard, named in honor
of General Benjamin Howard, was built on the site of the old French fort.
With the exception of 1820-22, when the troops were transferred to Camp Smith,
on the east shore, Fort Howard was continuously occupied until 1841, when its
garrison was ordered to Florida and Mexico. Later, from 1849 to 1851, it was
occupied by Colonel Francis Lee and Lieutenant-Colonel B. L. E. Bonneville, and
then permanently abandoned as a garrison, although a volunteer company was
stationed there for a short time during the War of Secession. Almost every trace
of the old fort has been obliterated. Consult <i>Wisconsin Historical Collections</i>, xvi,

Francis Parkman, the historian, was convinced that <i>Le Rocher</i> or Starved
Rock is the site of Fort St. Louis, erected by La Salle in December, 1682. On
his departure in the autumn of 1683, La Salle left the post in command of his
lieutenant, Henri de Tonty, who was soon succeeded by De Baugis. In 1690 Tonty
and La Forest were granted the proprietorship of the stronghold, but in 1702 it was
abandoned by royal order. By 1718 it was again occupied by the French, although
when Father Charlevoix passed three years later, it was once more deserted. The
tradition which gave rise to the name Starved Rock was well known; see <i>Tales
of the Border</i> (Philadelphia, 1834); Osman Eaton, <i>Starved Rock, a Historical Sketch</i>

not far from the landing at St. Louis.
</p><p>
With reference to the <i>human footprints in the rock at St. Louis</i>, I have given the
local tradition. Schoolcraft's detailed description, which I subjoin, varies from
this somewhat. The print of a human foot is said to have been discovered also
in the limestone at Herculaneum. Morse, in his <i>Universal Geography</i>, tells us of
the tracks of an army of men and horses on a certain mountain in the State of
Tennessee, fitly named the Enchanted Mountain.
</p><p>
"Before leaving Harmony, our attention was particularly directed to a tabular
mass of limestone, containing two apparent prints or impressions of the naked human
foot. This stone was carefully preserved in an open area, upon the premises of
Mr. Rappe, by whom it had previously been conveyed from the banks of the Mississippi,
at St. Louis. The impressions are, to all appearance, those of a man
standing in an erect posture, with the left foot a little advanced and the heels drawn
in. The distance between the heels, by accurate measurement, is six and a quarter
inches, and between the extremities of the toes thirteen and a half. But, by a close
inspection, it will be perceived that these are not the impressions of feet accustomed
to the European shoe; the toes being much spread, and the foot flattened in the
manner that is observed in persons unaccustomed to the close shoe. The
probability, therefore, of their having been imparted by some individual of a race of men
who were strangers to the art of tanning skins, and at a period much anterior to
that to which any traditions of the present race of Indians reaches, derives additional
weight from this peculiar shape of the feet.
</p><p>
"In other respects, the impressions are strikingly natural, exhibiting the muscular
marks of the foot with great precision and faithfulness to nature. This circumstance
weakens very much the supposition that they may, <i>possibly</i>, be specimens
of antique sculpture, executed by any former race of men inhabiting this
continent. Neither history nor tradition has preserved the slightest traces of such a
people. For it must be recollected that, as yet, we have no evidence that the people
who erected our stupendous Western tumuli possessed any knowledge of masonry,
far less of sculpture, or that they had even invented a chisel, a knife, or an axe,
other than those of porphyry, hornstone, or obsidian.
</p><p>
"The average length of the human foot in the male subject may, perhaps, be
assumed at ten inches. The length of each foot, in our subject, is ten and a quarter
inches: the breadth, taken across the toes, at right angles to the former line, four
inches; but the greatest spread of the toes is four and a half inches, which diminishes
to two and a half at the heel. Directly before the prints, and approaching
within a few inches of the left foot, is a well-impressed and deep mark, having
some resemblance to a scroll, whose greatest length is two feet seven inches, and
greatest breadth twelve and a half inches.
</p><p>
"The rock containing these interesting impressions is a compact limestone of
a grayish-blue colour. It was originally quarried on the left bank of the Mississippi
at St. Louis, and is a part of the extensive range of calcareous rocks upon
which that town is built. It contains very perfect remains of the encrinite, echinite,
and some other fossil species. The rock is firm and well consolidated, as much
so as any part of the stratum. A specimen of this rock, now before us, has a decidedly
sparry texture, and embraces a mass of black blende. This rock is extensively
used as a building material at St. Louis. On parting with its carbonic
acid and water, it becomes beautifully white, yielding an excellent quick-lime.
Foundations of private dwellings at St. Louis, and the military works erected by the
French and Spaniards from this material sixty years ago, are still as solid and
unbroken as when first laid. We cite these facts as evincing the compactness and
durability of the stone&mdash;points which must essentially affect any conclusions, to
be drawn from the prints we have mentioned, and upon which, therefore, we are
solicitous to express our decided opinion."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flagg.</span></p></div>

The attack on St. Louis mentioned by Flagg, occurred May 26, 1780. The
expedition, composed of Chippewa, Winnebago, Sioux, and other Indian tribes,
with a Canadian contingent numbering about seven hundred and fifty, started from
Mackinac. See R. G. Thwaites, <i>France in America</i> (New York and London,

navigators by the presence of bands of robbers. An incident occurred early in
1787, which led to a virtual extermination of these marauders. While ascending
the river, Beausoliel, a wealthy merchant of New Orleans, was attacked near Cotton
Wood Creek by the Culbert and Magilhay freebooters. After being captured, the
merchants made good their escape through the strategy of a negro, killed many of
their captors, and returned to New Orleans to report the state of affairs. The
following year (1788) the governor issued a proclamation forbidding boats to proceed
singly to St. Louis. Accordingly a fleet of ten boats ascended and destroyed
the lair at Cotton Wood Creek, the remaining robbers having fled at their approach.
This bloodless victory marks the close of the freebooting period. The
year was afterwards known in local annals as <i>L'Annee des dix Bateaux</i>. See

forming at the lower end of the city; by 1837, this had extended as far north as
Market street, forming an island more than two hundred acres in extent. Another
sand-bar was formed at the upper end of the city, west of Blood Island. In 1833 the
city authorities undertook the work of removal, and John Goodfellow was employed
to plow up the bars with ox teams, in order that high waters might carry away
the sand. After three thousand dollars had been expended without avail, the board
of aldermen petitioned Congress (1835) for relief. Through the efforts of Congressman
William H. Ashley, the federal government appropriated (July 4, 1836)
fifteen thousand dollars&mdash;later (March 3, 1837) increased to fifty thousand dollars&mdash;for

Joseph Miguel Taillon went to St. Louis (1765), constructed a dam across this
creek, and erected a mill near the intersection of Ninth and Poplar streets. Pierre
Laclede Liguest bought the property in 1767, but at his death (1778), Auguste Chouteau
purchased it at public auction and retained the estate until his own death in
1829. The latter built a large stone mill to take the place of Taillon's wooden
structure, and later replaced it by a still larger stone mill. The mill to which
Flagg probably refers was not demolished until 1863. Chouteau enlarged the pond
formed by Taillon's dam and beautified it. This artificial lake, a half mile in
length and three hundred yards in width, was long known as Chouteau's Pond,
and a noted pleasure-resort. In 1853 it was sold to the Missouri Pacific Railroad,
drained, and made the site of the union railway station and several manufacturing

Kaskaskia. The former was his brother's partner; the latter a well-known navigator
on the Mississippi River. Michel Menard, nephew of Pierre, had much
influence among the Indians and was chosen chief of the Shawnee. He founded
the city of Galveston, Texas. Pierre Menard left ten children.

Henry Gustavus Soulard, the second son of Antoine Pierre Soulard, was born
in St. Louis (1801). Frederic Louis Billon, in his <i>Annals of St. Louis</i> (1889), mentions
him as the last survivor of all those who were born in St. Louis prior to the
transfer of Louisiana to the United States (1803).

The origin of Shurtleff College was the "Theological and High School" commonly
known as the Rock Spring Seminary, established (1827) by John M.
Peck, D. D. The latter was closed in 1831, and opened again the following year
at Alton, under the name of Alton Seminary. In March, 1832, the state legislature
incorporated the institution as "Alton College of Illinois." For religious
reasons the charter was not accepted until 1835, when the terms of incorporation
had been made more favorable. In January, 1836, the charter was
amended, changing its title to Shurtleff College, in honor of Benjamin Shurtleff,
M. D., who had donated ten thousand dollars to the institution. Although
from the first emphasizing religious instruction, a theological department was not
organized until 1863. The school is still under Baptist influence.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<i>Gazetteer of Illinois</i> (Jacksonville, 1837), pp. 11, 12. The term barrens, according
to the <i>Century Dictionary</i>, is "a tract or region of more or less unproductive land
partly or entirely treeless. The term is best known in the United States as the
name of a district in Kentucky, 'The Barrens,' underlaid by the subcarboniferous
limestone, but possessing a fertile soil, which was nearly or quite treeless when that
state began to be settled by the whites, but which at present where not cultivated,
is partly covered with trees." See a good description in our volume iii, pp. 217-224.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

a Fort Gaines was at one time located at Gainesville, Alachua County, Florida.
The town is now the seat of East Florida Seminary, a military school. Among
the numerous lakes in the vicinity, Alachua, the largest, occupies what was formerly
Payne's Prairie. Through this prairie a stream issuing from Newman's Lake
flowed to a point near the middle of the district, where it suddenly fell into an
unfathomed abyss named by the Indians Alachua (the bottomless pit). The
whites gave this name to the county, and called the abyss "Big Sink." This
place became a favorite pleasure resort until 1875, when the sink refused longer
to receive the water, and Payne's Prairie, formerly a rich grazing land, was turned
into a lake. Numerous tales connected with Big Sink were circulated, and it seems
probable that Flagg is referring to this locality.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Simon Kenton (1755-1836) having, as he supposed, killed a neighbor in a fight,
fled from his home in Virginia to the headwaters of the Ohio River. He served
as a scout in Dunmore's War (1774) and in 1775 with Boone, explored the interior
of Kentucky. Captured by the Indians (1778), he was condemned to death and
taken to the native village at Lower Sandusky, whence he made his escape. Later
he served with distinction in campaigns under George Rogers Clark, and was second
only to Daniel Boone as a frontier hero. In 1784, Kenton founded a settlement
near Limestone (Maysville), Kentucky. He took part in Wayne's Campaign
(1793-94), and was present at the Battle of the Thames (1813). In 1820 he moved
to Logan County, Ohio, and sixteen years later died there in poverty, although
before going to Ohio in 1802 he was reputed as one of the wealthiest men in Kentucky.

Colonel William Whitley (1749-1813), born in Virginia, set out for Kentucky
about 1775, and built in 1786 or 1787 one of the first brick houses in the state,
near Crab Orchard, in Lincoln County. A noted Indian fighter, he participated
in the siege of Logan's fort (1777), and Clark's campaigns of 1782, and 1786.
He also led several parties to recover white captives&mdash;his best known feat of this
character being the rescue of Mrs. Samuel McClure (1784). In 1794 he was the
active leader of the successful Nickajack expedition, directed against the Indians
south of Tennessee River. He fell at the Battle of the Thames (1813), whereat
it was maintained by some of his admirers, he killed the Indian chief Tecumseh.

Taking a lively interest in the welfare of the colonists, he attained among them
high popularity. Quite early, he conceived the idea of extending the Virginia
settlement beyond the mountains, to intercept the French communications between
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico; but he failed to secure the aid either of his province
or of the mother country. In the summer of 1716 he organized and led an expedition
for exploring the Appalachian Mountains, named two peaks George and Spotswood,
and took possession of the Valley of Virginia in the name of George I. On
his return, he established the order of "Tramontane," for carrying on further explorations,
whose members were called "Knights of the Golden Horseshoe," for
the reason which Flagg gives. For a contemporary account of this expedition,
see "Journal of John Fontaine" in Anna Maury, <i>Memoirs of a Huguenot Family</i>
(New York, 1853). Spotswood was displaced as governor in 1722, but was later
(1730) appointed deputy postmaster of the colonies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Gideon Blackburn, a Presbyterian minister, laid a plan in 1835 for founding
a college to educate young men for the ministry. He entered land from the government
at the price of one dollar and twenty-five cents an acre, and disposed of
it to the friends of his cause at two dollars, reserving twenty-five cents for his
expenses and turning over the remaining fifty cents to the proposed college. By
May, 1837, he had entered over 16,656 acres. The people of Carlinville purchased
eighty acres from him for the site of the school. The enterprise lay dormant until
1857, when the state chartered the school under the title of Blackburn University,
which was opened in 1859.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

1539. With about 1000 men, 213 of whom were provided with horses, he undertook
the conquest of Florida and countries adjacent. After cutting their way in
various directions through numerous tribes of Indians, traversing nearly 1000 miles
of country, losing a great part of their army, their general died upon the banks of
the Mississippi, and the survivors were obliged to build vessels in which to descend
the river; which, when they had done, they sailed for Mexico. This expedition
was five years in coming to nothing, and bringing ruin upon its performers. A
populous Indian town at this time stood at or near the mouth of the Mobile, of
which <i>Soto's</i> army had possessed themselves. Their intercourse with the Indians

<i>Comment by Ed.</i> Rock Spring was a mere settlement in St. Clair County,
eighteen miles from St. Louis, on the Vincennes stage road, and about three miles
southwest of Lebanon. Its name was derived from a series of springs issuing from
a rocky ledge in the vicinity. John M. Peck selected this site (1820) for his permanent
residence, and established the Rock Spring Theological Seminary and High
School (1827), which four years later was transferred to Alton and made the foundation
of Shurtleff College. In 1834 Rock Spring consisted of fourteen families.</p></div>

Mr. Austin to Mr. Schoolcraft, respecting the navigation of the Missouri, well portrays
the impetuous character of that river. It shows, too, the great improvements
in the steam-engine during the past twenty years.
</p><p>
"I regret to state that the expedition up the Missouri to the Yellow Stone has
in part failed. The steamboats destined for the Upper Missouri, after labouring
against the current for a number of weeks, were obliged to give up the enterprise.
Every exertion has been made to overcome the difficulty of navigating the Missouri
with the power of steam; but all will not do. The current of that river, from the
immense quantity of sand moving down with the water, is too powerful for any
boat yet constructed. The loss either to the government or to the contractor will
be very great. Small steamboats of fifty tons burden, with proper engines, would,
I think, have done much better. Boats like those employed, of twenty to thirty
feet beam, and six to eight feet draught of water, must have <i>uncommon</i> power to
be propelled up a river, every pint of whose water is equal in weight to a quart of
Ohio water, and moves with a velocity hardly credible. The barges fixed to move
with wheels, worked by men, have answered every expectation; but they will only
do when troops are on board, and the men can be changed every hour."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flagg.</span></p></div>

The duel mentioned by Flagg is probably the one that occurred between Joshua
Barton, United States district attorney, and Thomas Rector, on June 30, 1823.
Barton had published in the <i>Missouri Republican</i> a letter charging William Rector,
surveyor general of Missouri, Illinois, and Arkansas, with corruption in office.
The latter being absent, his brother Thomas issued the challenge. Barton's body
was buried at St. Charles near the old round tower ruins.
</p><p>
In the summer of 1817, Charles Lucas challenged Thomas H. Benton's vote
at the polls. On the latter calling him an insolent puppy, Lucas challenged him
to a duel. The affair took place August 12, 1817, and both parties were wounded.
On September 27 of the same year, a second duel was fought, in which Lucas was
mortally wounded. Joshua Barton was the latter's second. In the <i>Missouri Republican</i>
(St. Louis, March 15, 1882) there was printed an address by Thomas
T. Gantt, delivered in Memorial Hall at St. Louis, on the celebration of the centennial
birthday of Thomas H. Benton, in which the details of this deed were carefully
reviewed.
</p><p>
During the political canvass of 1830, a heated discussion was carried on in the
newspaper press between Thomas Biddle and Spencer Pettis. Pettis challenged
Biddle to a duel. Both fell mortally wounded, August 29, 1830.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

on the margin of this bench, at the depth of four feet, we discovered great quantities
of broken pottery, belonging to vessels of all sizes and characters. Some must
have been of a size to contain four gallons. This must have been a very populous

a site for a town to be styled Andover, which was eventually platted in 1841, in the
western portion of Henry County, fifty miles north and northwest of Peoria. The
first settlers were principally from Connecticut, but soon several Swedish families
migrated thither, and in time the settlement was composed primarily of that
nationality. On returning East in the autumn of 1835, after planting the
Andover colony, Pillsbury had an interview with Dr. Caleb J. Tenny, of Wethersfield,
Connecticut. At the latter's instigation a meeting of Congregationalists was
held, and a group of influential New Englanders organized themselves into the Connecticut
Association. Shares were sold at $250 each, which entitled the holder to
one hundred and sixty acres of prairie land, twenty acres of timber land, and a town
lot in a proposed colony to be founded in Illinois. On May 7, 1836, the first
entry was made by the committee of purchase. After the latter's return a new
committee was sent out and the town of Wethersfield, in the southeastern corner
of Henry County, was laid out in the spring of 1837. For an account of the

north and south forks. The former, rising in Champaign County, flows through
Macon and a part of Sangamon counties; the latter intersects Christian County.
The main stream runs in an easterly direction, forms the boundary of Cass County,
and joins the Illinois River nine miles above Beardstown. The river is nearly two
hundred and forty miles in length, including the north fork, and was named in
honor of a local Indian chief.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

a general term applied to the prairie country between the rivers which flow into
the Mississippi and those which empty into the Wabash. "It is made up of continuous
tracts, with long arms of prairie extending between the creeks and smaller
streams. The southern points of the Grand prairie are formed in the northeastern
parts of Jackson county and extend in a northeastern course between the streams
of various widths, from one to ten or twelve miles, through Perry, Washington,
Jefferson, Marion, the eastern part of Fayette, Effingham, through the western
portion of Coles, into Champaign and Iroquois counties, where it becomes connected
with the prairies that project eastward from the Illinois River and its tributaries.
Much of the longest part of the Grand prairie is gently undulatory, but
of the southern portion considerable tracts are flat and of rather inferior soil."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Pennsylvania, and later associated with the Disciples in Ohio, established
a branch of the Mormon church with one hundred members at Kirtland, Ohio.
Joseph Smith, who had founded the last-named church at Fayette, New York
(April 6, 1830), went to Kirtland in February of the following year. Aided by
Rigdon, Smith attempted to establish a mixed communistic and hierarchical organized
community. Mormon tanneries, stores, and other enterprises were built,
and the corner-stone of a $40,000 temple laid July 23, 1833. Through improvident
financial management, the leaders soon plunged the community deeply in
debt. The Kirtland Society Bank, reorganized as the Kirtland Anti-Bankers
Company, after issuing notes to the amount of $200,000, failed, and Smith and
Rigdon further embarrassed by an accumulation of troubles fled to Jackson County,
Missouri, where Oliver Cowdery by the former's order had established the Far
West settlement. Joseph Smith was assassinated by a mob (June 27, 1844) at
Carthage, Illinois, and Brigham Young succeeded him. Sidney Rigdon, long one
of Smith's chief advisers, and one of the three presidents of the Mormon church at
Nauvoo, combated the doctrine of plurality of wives. He refused to recognize
the authority of Young as Smith's successor, and returned to Pennsylvania, but
held to the Mormon faith until his death in 1876. In 1848 the charter granted
to the city of Nauvoo by the Illinois state legislature, was repealed. The
Mormons thereupon selected Utah as the field of their future activity, save
that a few members were left in Missouri for proselyting purposes.

Alexander Campbell (1788-1866), educated at the University of Glasgow, came
to the United States (1809) and joined the Presbyterian church. Refusing to
recognize any teachings save those of the Bible, as he understood them, he and
his father, Thomas Campbell, were dismissed (1812) and with a few followers
formed a temporary union with the Baptist church. Disfellowshiped in 1827,
they organized the Disciples of Christ, popularly known as the Campbellites.
The son published the <i>Christian Baptist</i>, a monthly magazine, its name being
changed (1830) to the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i>. He held several public offices in the
state of Virginia, and in 1840 founded Bethany (Virginia) College.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>
